<H2>Course objectives</H2>

<P>15-410, Operating System Design &amp; Implementation, 
is a programming-intensive OS class.  The core experience
is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86
assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware simulator called
Simics (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in
two-person teams, and "team programming" skills (source control,
modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  Core concepts include
the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and
deadlock.  The course includes one medium-sized non-textbook reading
assignment with a writing component.  If you have already completed
an implementation-intensive OS class (one based on, e.g., NACHOS),
ECE's Embedded Systems class might be a better opportunity for
growth.  Finally, past experience suggests that 15-410 is a
challenging class.  Students who successfully complete it will
learn a lot, but it will not be easy.</P>

<H2>About This Document</H2>

<P>This document sets forth our high-level expectations for the class.
You must also read the companion document on
<A HREF="policies.html">Policies &amp; Mechanisms</A>.</P>

<H2>Textbook</H2>

<P>The textbook is <Cite>Operating System Concepts</Cite>, by 
Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne. 
It is available in CMU's bookstore.
While the official text will be the eighth edition,
you should be able to get by with the seventh or sixth editions.
We will not
cover all of the text, and some topics (such as synchronization)
will be taught in a different manner.</P>

<P>You may also find useful the 15-213 textbook, <CITE>Computer Systems:
A Programmer's Perspective</CITE>; the K&amp;R C book; and perhaps
<CITE>C Traps and Pitfalls</CITE>.
An excellent source of suggestions for programming style and structure
is
Rob Pike and Brian Kernigan's
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/tpop/">The Practice of Programming</a>,
especially the first few chapters.
</P>

<H2>Prerequisites</H2>

<P>According to the 
<A HREF="http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/bscs/ugcourses.html">SCS
Undergraduate Courses</A> page,
the official prerequisite for this class is
15-213 (Introduction to Computer Systems).
We expect students to have taken 15-213 before taking 15-410
(be sure to read the <A HREF="policies.html#prerequisites">Prerequisities</A>
section of the
<A HREF="policies.html">Policies &amp; Mechanisms</A> document for
further details).</P>

<P>Furthermore, please be aware that this course <STRONG>relies</STRONG>
on skills acquired in 15-213.
This means you'll be in trouble if much of what was covered there has
been forgotten, or if finishing it was a significant struggle.
You should recall what
a byte is, what a register is, the meaning of "1<<2", the difference
between a process and a thread, roughly what goes in a stack frame,
what virtual memory is, what a cache is, etc.  You should be proficient
in C programming on UNIX systems,
including the use of <TT>make</TT> and a source-level debugger such as
<TT>gdb</TT> or <TT>dbx</TT>.  The class will require
writing small amounts of x86 assembly language,
and debugging your OS will require you to be able to map back and
forth between C and assembly language, so it is <EM>very important</EM>
that you are have retained these skills.
</P>



<H2>Course Activity</H2>

<P>While we do not take attendance in class, we expect
students to attend lectures.  If you miss a lecture,
we expect you to arrange for a fellow student
who was in class to teach you what you missed by going
over the lecture slides with you.  When possible, it
is probably wise for you to obtain the agreement of
a particular fellow student before the class you
miss.
Our model for the lecture slides is that they
<EM>support</EM> the lecture and can also support
a student-led recapitulation, but that they do not
<EM>replace</EM> the lecture.
</P>

<P>While some material will not be covered fully
by the textbook, the text will expand on some material
covered only partially in class.  Thus, reading the
relevant sections of the text is wise, and some
people will find a second or third reading of some
sections useful.</P>

<P>In general, most students who do well in the class
will attend lectures regularly and read the textbook
thoroughly.</P>



<P>We will grade homeworks, a "book report" assignment, several
programming assignments, a mid-term exam, and a final exam.</P>

<P>In slightly more detail:
<DL>

<DT>Homework assignments
<DD>
<P>Homework assignments are individual assignments designed to 
reinforce class material through design, analysis, restatement, 
or simple practice. Although each student should do his/her own
homework, students are certainly encouraged to discuss the course 
material related to the homework to develop a better understanding.</P>

<DT>Team Projects
<DD>
<P>Projects (other than the first two) are designed for two person teams.
When choosing a partner, try to ensure that the relationship will
last for the remainder of the semester.  We will allow changes
if the situation merits it and if alternative partners are available.
While some people end up working by themselves, we actively discourage
this and generally don't view it as a reason for relaxed deadlines
or grading.</P>

<P>Both partners 
should work cooperatively on the design, implementation, and 
testing of their solutions.</P>

<P>The programming assignments, especially the kernel
assignment, are <STRONG>not easy</STRONG>.  It is far from
unusual for a single one-line bug to take <STRONG>two days</STRONG>
to track down.  You should plan to finish each project 10%-20%
early.</P>

<DT>Exams
<DD>
<P>The exams may cover any material covered in the course. This 
includes the material from the lectures, from the assigned sections 
of the textbook, from the additional reading assignments handed out, 
from the programming projects, or from the homework.</P>
</DL>

<H2>Team Programming</H2>

<P>Most of the programming effort will be in a team-programming context,
to give you experience with the design strategies, coding standards,
documentation practices, source control techniques, and people
skills you are likely to need in both industry and academia.
Here we differentiate between team programming and software engineering
in that we will not cover requirements analysis, release staging,
defect management, and other life-cycle issues.</P>

<P>You may experiment with various development styles.  Some students
explore "Extreme Programming", and others have had good experiences with
<CITE>Pair Programming</CITE> (Williams &amp; Kessler).</P>

<P>You should probably discuss your committment to the class with potential
partners.  For example, if it is spring semester and you are planning to
graduate, a first-year drama student auditing the class
might not make the best partner for you.</P>

<H2>Grades</H2>

<P>Our overall expectation on grades is:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>C<DD>All parts of problem addressed
<DT>B<DD>Solution is complete, stable, robust; no major design flaws, etc.
<DT>A<DD>Excellent:  design is clean, documentation is complete,
error handling and logging are good.  Probably one or more "good-quality"
algorithms are used (as appropriate); it should be credible that
somebody might want to re-use some of your code; often you will
have done a little bit more than what we asked in a couple of areas.
</DL>

<H2>Academic Conduct</H2>

<P>In general, collaboration is good when it furthers genuine
learning and bad when it doesn't.  Meanwhile, plagiarism
(using the work
of others without giving them appropriate credit) is definitely
bad.  This principle can often help you decide between good
collaboration and bad collaboration:  if you would feel bad
about accurately giving credit for part of your program,
then it probably shouldn't have been created however it was.
Another good rule is that if you're not sure whether something
is ok, you should ask the course staff.</P>

<P>Also, in general, we expect you to behave honestly and
according to high standards of academic conduct.</P>

<H2>Reminder About This Document</H2>
