<H2>About This Document</H2>

<P>This document sets forth specific policies and mechanisms for
this class.  You must also read the companion document on
high-level <A HREF="expectations.html">Expectations</A>.</P>

<A NAME="prerequisites"><H2>Prerequisites</H2></A>

<P>If you have not completed 15-213 with a grade of C or above,
you <STRONG>must</STRONG> contact the course staff and complete
a skill assessment exercise to remain registered in the class.
This requirement <STRONG>specifically</STRONG> includes all
graduate students, exchange students, non-degree students,
and any other special students.
This also includes all students who have taken Operating System
classes other than 15-410.</P>

<A NAME="auditing"><H2>Auditing</H2></A>

<P>Please see the "Audit Grades" section of the
University's
<A HREF="http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html">Grading
Policies</A> document.  Students auditing a class are required
to to commit to some level of participation, and to meet that
commitment in order to receive an audit grade at the end
of the semester.
</P>

<H2>Getting Help</H2>

<P>The class web site is
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/</A>.</P>

<P>You should read and participate in <TT>academic.cs.15-410.qa</TT>
and <STRONG>are required to monitor</STRONG>
<TT>academic.cs.15-410.announce</TT> (if your mail client can be
set to alert you of new messages, that would be a good idea).</P>

<P>Issues particular to you or your group, and time-critical
issues, can be addressed to
<IMG SRC="img/staff-410.gif" ALT="staff-410@cs.cmu.edu">.
If you need to discuss a genuinely confidential issue you
should contact the instructor(s) directly.
But you <STRONG>should not</STRONG>
send e-mail to randomly-selected
staff members to ask clarification or
guidance questions--if nothing else, you may choose somebody
who is sick or out of town.</P>

<P>Please <STRONG>do not</STRONG> send us files via electronic
mail.  Really!  If you want us to look at some of your files, you
should put them into a private AFS directory, make sure we can read
it, and send us the filename.  If you use course-issued AFS space,
this is easy, since 410 staff can automatically read that.  If you
use some other AFS space, you will need to do something like
this:</P>

<P><CODE>% fs sa . de0u:410staff rl</CODE><BR>
<CODE>% fs sa .. de0u:410staff l</CODE><BR>
<CODE>% fs sa ../.. de0u:410staff l</CODE><BR>
Eventually you will be told "permission denied" and then you are
probably done.</P>

<H2>AFS access control lists</H2>

<P>Be sure to store your work in a protected area.  Since a new 
AFS directory inherits its parent's access control list, it is
possible to create a directory which inadvertently is public.</P>

<H2>AFS problems</H2>

<P>Like any other large complicated thing, AFS can have problems.
If it happens to you, please <STRONG>start</STRONG> by re-reading
<a href="afs.html">About your 15-410 AFS Space</a>--please don't
e-mail us a question which is already answered in that document.</P>

<H2>Formatting</H2>

<P>"Documents" should be submitted in a document interchange/publication
format such as PDF or HTML (or, if appropriate,
Unix-line-delimited 7-bit ASCII).  Microsoft Word, WordPerfect,
OpenOffice XML, FrameMaker editable-document format, etc.,
<STRONG>are not interchange formats</STRONG>.
PostScript is really a printer transport language
rather than a document interchange format, but it will generally
suffice.</P>

<P>Also, if we ask you to use a particular filename for something, please
do that.  We probably intend to use a program to perform some action
(such as printing) on all 100-odd files, and if your file doesn't have
the right name maybe the right thing won't happen to it.</P>

<H2>Hazards</H2>

<H3>Medical issues</H3>

<P>If you experience a medical problem which disrupts your studies,
please go to Student Health Services (or another medical provider)
and have them emit some piece of paper
describing the situation and what you are <EM>medically required</EM>
to do about it.  If there are privacy concerns, we will accept
a firm statement of the restrictions on your activities without
a description of the condition itself.</P>

<P>Please <STRONG>do not</STRONG> come to the course
staff and tell us that you've been too sick to attend class and
code for two weeks but that it hasn't "been bad enough" to merit
medical attention.  If nothing else, it probably <EM>has</EM> been
"bad enough" for your partner.</P>

<P>You may prefer to disclose an ongoing medical situation to
Mark Stehlik and/or Catharine Fichtner (or your home department's
undergraduate chair and/or administrator).
They can then take care of notifying all of your instructors.</P>

<H3>Partner problems</H3>

<P>Please try to avoid having partner trouble.  Seriously!  Share
your hopes before they turn into concerns, your concerns before
they become problems, and your problems before they inflate into
crises.</P>

<P>Also, in order for the course staff to help you and your partner
work through issues, or for us to provide special treatment in
response to serious partner problems, you <STRONG>must</STRONG>
contact us <STRONG>well before</STRONG> the relevant due date.
While some problems can never be truly solved, it is likely that
your career after CMU will require you to "involve management"
to address issues with co-workers... if you find yourself in
a situation which you can't resolve, this will provide you with
an opportunity to practice interacting with management.
</P>

<P>One special case to avoid is coming to us a day or two before
a major deadline to tell us that your partner has been ill for
multiple weeks.  We, and thus you, have many more options if
you inform us <STRONG>while</STRONG> a problem is developing,
as opposed to after the fact.

<H2>Exams</H2>

<P>Exams will be closed-book.  For the final exam you will
probably be permitted to bring in a single sheet of notes.</P>

<P>At CMU, standard operating procedure is that final
exams take place after classes end, during a special
period of time.  Each class is assigned an exam period
according to a university-wide procedure which attempts
to minimize conflicts.</P>

<P>What this means is that the date and time of the 15-410
final exam will not be decided by the course staff, and
we do not know
when the university will make the decision (the schedule
is posted at approximately the same time every semester,
but there is some variation).</P>

<P>It is <STRONG>your</STRONG> responsibility to alert the
course staff to any exam conflicts.  If we haven't heard from
you seven days after a 15-410 exam date has been published,
we will expect that to mean you do not have a conflict.  In
any case, notify us as soon as possible.</P>

<H2>Collaboration and Group Work</H2>

<P>We think a lot can be learned by talking to other students,
and, since we're pro-learning, this is generally ok with us.
Discussing your data structures, module boundaries, and even
the flow through your code is fine.  Writing down snippets
of code on a whiteboard is also ok (especially if you
gesticulate wildly while doing so and use several colors).</P>

<P>However, some sorts of "collaboration", which reduce or
impede learning, are not acceptable, such as:
<UL>
<LI>"Discussing" code in sufficient detail to
fully specify it (see, for example, Jonathan Baccash's
<A HREF="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS/Baccash/">BabelBuster
C to English to C Translator</A>.
<LI>Copying or typing in code from other people, or any
OS class you might have taken before (if you can meaningfully
do the latter, there is a good chance you shouldn't be taking
this class for credit).  You should also not be <EM>reading</EM>
code produced by other people for OS classes at CMU or elsewhere,
or components from "how to write your own mini-OS" kits.
<LI>Allowing other people to type in code for you or debug your
code.
<LI>Allowing other people to read your code before it is turned
in or before they have turned in their own code.
This includes keeping any network-accessible copies of your
code protected (note that the default settings on many
repository-hosting services such as bitbucket or gitorious
are <STRONG>not</STRONG> correct).
</UL></P>

<P>In the other direction:
<UL>
<LI>You may read books about operating system internals and
browse "professional" OS code (e.g., a BSD kernel,
the Linux kernel, etc.).
<LI>It's ok to re-use basic code from lower-level classes.
<!--
If you have to sort something, it's fine to consult a book
or even type in code from one (giving appropriate credit,
of course). -->
However, you may not use other code which you did not
write without <STRONG>prior</STRONG> permission
of the course staff.
</UL></P>

<P>If you think you have encountered a gray area,
please contact the course staff <STRONG>before</STRONG>
making a decision.</P>

<P>You should have a reasonable understanding of all code
your group turns in, even parts you didn't write.  One easy
way to think about this is that exam questions which assume
understanding of project components are fair game.
Also, while we hope this will be a rare occurence, we
we reserve the right to assign partners different grades
for a project.</P>

<P>Homework assignments are individual.  Your model should be
that you can talk about the problems, but then you must erase
the whiteboard or shred the napkin, retreat to your cave,
and write them up yourself.</P>

<P>If you question the legality of any type of collaboration or
consultation, please ask.  If you are in a real bind, do what feels
right and discuss the issue with a staffer as soon as is possible.
If you discuss the issue with us before you turn in your solution
or document it as part of your solution, it will not be considered
to be academic dishonesty (of course, it might not qualify for full
credit, either).</P>

<P>You should be aware that there are several
sophisticated code-similarity analysis tools based on
machine-learning techniques.  Fooling them is possible,
but probably requires enough work (and worry) that it
is probably better for you to do the assignments yourself.</P>

<P>Academic dishonesty may result in a failing course grade,
and will typically be reported to your home academic unit
and/or the Dean of Students.  Please don't get involved
in this--it costs everybody <STRONG>enormous</STRONG>
amounts of time during which nothing can be learned about
operating systems.</P>

<H3>Distribution of Coursework Solutions</H3>

<P>As a condition of your participation in the course,
you may not make publicly available or distribute to
others code you write to solve problems posed by
course assignments.</P>

<H2>Working Alone on "Group" Projects</H2>

<P>While it is possible to complete the major programming
projects while working alone, that is not the best approach
for most students.  If you intend to work alone, you must
obtain permission from the instructor(s).</P>

<H2>Grades</H2>

<P>Documentation will be a component of your course grades.
The exact percentage may vary from one assignment to the next,
and may be adjusted in response to class performance, but
your model should probably be that documentation will be
worth approximately 5% of each programming assignment.</P>

<P>In general we will have a "7 CMU business day" deadline on
grade appeals.  That is not to say that we will <EM>never</EM>
engage in grading archaeology, but we believe we can obtain
a greater degree of consistency inside a smaller time window.</P>

<P>Here is a <EM>tentative, approximate</EM> grading breakdown.</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
  <TR><TH>Weight</TH><TH> Item</TH></TR>
  <TR><TD>5%</TD><TD>Zeroth Programming Project</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD>5%</TD><TD>First Programming Project</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD>15%</TD><TD>Second Programming Project</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD>25%</TD><TD>Third Programming Project</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD>5%</TD><TD>Fourth Programming Project</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD>15%</TD><TD>Midterm Exam</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD>20%</TD><TD>Final Exam</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD>10%</TD><TD>Homeworks (~3) and book report</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>There is an excellent chance that the weight of the kernel
project will be increased somewhat, probably at the expense of
the homeworks.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>In addition, your weighted project average and weighted exam
average must each be a passing grade in order to pass the course.</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P>Cutoff points for grades will be set by the course staff
based on an examination of the quality of the work turned in by students
near the border.  Likewise, individual students, especially those
near a cutoff, may receive adjustments upward or downward based
on factors such as quality improvement, final exam scores,
dramatic differences between partners,
or
other circumstances relevant to the estimation of the staff
of which grade best represents the student's work.</P>

<P>Finally, while we do our best to specify our expectations
in advance, grade assignment is at the discretion of the course
instructor.</P>

<H2>Policy on Late Work</H2>

Here is a somewhat traditional OS policy on late work:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Each student may grant himself or herself an extension <b>on any
homework assignment or project deadline/checkpoint</b> -- but
<b>only three (3) days worth of extensions</b>
are available during the course of the
semester under this policy. Possible configurations include turning in three
projects one day late apiece, turning in each homework assignment one day late, etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
If a team wishes an extension under this policy, the number of days available
is the <b>minimum</b> of the number of days that each member has available.
Because this might become an issue if you switch partners, it is probably
unwise to use up too many late days on the earlier assignments.</P>

<P>Please understand that the use of extensions may, perhaps severely, 
delay the grading of your assignment. This isn't intended as punishment, 
it is just the natural consequence of the need to have all of the
staff assembled to fairly assign grades. We'll do our best to be timely,
but once extensions are injected into the system, this can sometimes
become difficult.</P>

<P>We encourage you to reserve extensions for the inevitable:
minor illnesses, conferences, University trips, bad karma, &amp;c.
But you are free to use them for any reason that you'd like. Just please remember
that you have only a small fixed number of extensions.</P>

<P>Extensions beyond the standard quota will only be granted for extremely
unusual, extremely unforeseeable, and/or extremely incapacitating circumstances. 
It is likely that we would require significant evidence of the circumstance 
and would consult with administrators and/or academic advisors before 
granting any further extensions.  Your grade could be affected, and it is
possible that you would be required to take an incomplete grade.</P>

<P>To grant yourself a <STRONG>one-day</STRONG> extension under this
policy, use the
<A HREF="late.html">late-day registration form</A>.  Please do
so by 00:30 (thirty minutes after the deadline) if possible.
You may grant yourself multiple one-day extensions for a single
project if that turns out to be necessary.</P>

<H2>A note on the Simics license</H2>

<P>Your use of the Simics simulation software takes place under
a software license.  Before using Simics for anything other than
15-410 class assignments, please see the instructor to ensure that
your planned activities are in accordance with CMU's license.</P>

<H2>Recording of lectures</H2>

<P>Classroom activities may be taped or recorded by a student for
the personal use of that student or for all students presently
enrolled in the class only,
but may not be further copied, distributed, published or otherwise
used for any other purpose without the express written consent of
the instructor(s).</P>

<!--
No student may record or tape any classroom activity without the express
written consent of [insert name of faculty member].  Students seeking
permission to record or tape classroom activities should contact [insert
name of faculty member] or the Office of Disability Resources as appropriate.
