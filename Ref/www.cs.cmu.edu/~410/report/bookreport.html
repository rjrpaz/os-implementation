<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This assignment is due Friday,
April 29th at 23:59:59.  Please note that any
conflict between any late days you might wish
to take and the university's final exam policy
is your responsibility, i.e., you may wish to
plan ahead and complete this assignment on time.</FONT></P>

<P>Please submit your report
in either PostScript or PDF format (not:
Microsoft Word, Word Perfect, Apple Works, LaTeX, XyWriter, WordStar,
etc.).
Submit your work by placing it in the appropriate
place, i.e.,
<KBD>/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15410-s11/usr/$USER/report/$USER.pdf</KBD>
(if you use a randomly-selected other filename, such as
<KBD>my-book-report-for-15-410.pdf</KBD>
the mass-printing script will miss it and your grade may
be delayed as a result).</P>

<P><STRONG>Please be sure your name and Andrew username appear on the first page
of the report.</STRONG>  Also, clearly indicate what you read.
You wouldn't believe how many people manage to omit some of this
information.</P>

<H2>Approved books</H2>

<P>See <A HREF="okbooks.html">the list of pre-approved books</A> and
then tell us your choice
(or make a suggestion) on the <A HREF="bookchoice.html">book choice
registration
page</A>.</P>

<H2>Book Report Contents</H2>

<P>You should expect to write one to two solid pages of text,
though you may write more if you genuinely wish (each
semester we get a few four-page reports, but two good pages
is really enough).
While presentation clarity will probably be an important
part of your career skill set, I will not be grading this
the way an English teacher would.
On the other hand, since I was <EM>raised</EM> by an English
teacher,
please pay some attention to style so I don't need to
suffer unnecessarily.</P>

<P>Please be sure to address, in one to three paragraphs apiece,
each of the following topics.</P>

<H3>Question 1: Educational value of material</H3>

<P>What was the most surprising, interesting, or eye-opening
material you found in what you read?  If you want, you can
fall back to summarizing everything you read, but I'd rather
you focused on what was the most valuable to you.</P>

<H3>Question 2: Recommendation</H3>

<P>Would you recommend this material to your friends
or co-workers?  To which ones?  Why?  In the course of reading this,
did you find out about some other material you would
recommend?  What, and why?</P>

<H3>Question 3: Value of this assignment</H3>

<P>This assignment is probably somewhat unusual for CS
courses.  Do you think it was worth your time?  Please
feel free to recommend improvements in the format of
the assignment.</P>
