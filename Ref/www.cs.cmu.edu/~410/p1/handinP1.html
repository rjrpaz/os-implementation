<LI><P>
Your files should be placed in your <STRONG>p1</STRONG> directory,
<STRONG>not</STRONG> somewhere else, such as <TT>hw1</TT>.  If you
haven't stored files in your AFS volume yet, please
refer to <A HREF="/~410/afs.html">About your 15-410 AFS Space</A>
for help if you run into trouble.  We are <STRONG>not responsible</STRONG>
if you wait until 23:50 to try out your AFS volume and run into trouble.
</P>

<LI><P>
Please do <STRONG>not</STRONG> add levels of indirection when
turning in your files.  For example, do not place your
<TT>game_kern_main.c</TT> in <TT>p1/proj1/kern/game_kern_main.c</TT> or
turn in <TT>p1/my_project_one.tar</TT>.  Please use the most
straightforward arrangement, i.e., <TT>p1/kern/game_kern_main.c</TT>.

<LI><P>
When the deadline arrives, we will write-lock your hand-in directory.
You will continue to be able to view the contents.
</P>

<LI><P>
When we grade your work, we will overwrite files which are not
in kern/ with a mixture of the files which update.sh installed
for you.  We will then add and modify some files.  This means
that you <STRONG>must</STRONG> confine your modifications to
files located in kern/, with the exception of config.mk.
You should make sure you have followed all the directions in
config.mk carefully, and that <TT>make clean</TT> followed
by <TT>make</TT> will build both the game and the tester
properly (we may deduct points if your assignment
doesn't build "out of the box").  Please <TT>make veryclean</TT>
in your handin directory after turning in your files--the
AFS space you save will be your own!
See
<A HREF="/~410/p1/proj1.html#dualimage">Grading
Makefile and Dual Images</A> for more information.
Recall that, no matter what flavor of machine you used to prepare
your assignment, it must build and run on Andrew cluster Linux
machines.
</P>

<LI><P>
You must also make sure that <TT>make html_doc</TT> and
<TT>make print</TT> do the right thing.
</P>

<LI><P>
Your deliverables are:
<UL>
<LI>Various .c and .S files (located in kern/).
<LI>.h files (located in kern/inc/).
<LI>README.dox
<LI>Any *.mk files -- since you needed to configure them
for your project to build/print/etc., if you don't turn them in,
your project won't build/print/etc....
</UL></P>
<P>
Please <STRONG>do not include</STRONG>:
<UL>
<LI>.o files
<LI><EM>executable</EM> files such as <TT>game</TT>, <TT>410test</TT>
<LI>.img files
<LI>fake.c
</UL>
<!-- (so you should probably <TT>make clean</TT> before ?). -->
</P>

<P>
Things not mentioned on either list above (the 410kern/ directory,
 etc.) are <STRONG>at your discretion</STRONG>.
You can assume that if
we gave them to you once we won't mind giving them to you
again.
</P>

<LI><P>
If you need to take a late day for Project 1 (you shouldn't!),
use the <A HREF="/~410/late.html">Late Day Registration Page</A>,
by roughly 00:30.
Assuming your message is received,
the next morning somebody will unlock your hand-in
directory so you can again save your work.
Please note that the auto-response may appear like a delivery
failure notice to some mail user agents; you will need to
look at the "error details" inside.
Of course, your request must be in accordance with the
policy published in <A HREF="/~410/syllabus.html">the syllabus</A>.
</P>
