Here you should tell us about how your game works. How to play, any special rules you have, etc. Also, explain any non-trivial design decisions you make, like how your ball gets its position updated, how you designed your buffer for readchar(), etc. You should also comment on the stability of your code. Any big bugs should be listed here. Basically, anything that you think we need to know in general about your project should go here.<p>
Any additional comments you want to make can go here. Did you like the project? Was it too hard, too easy? My TA smells bad. Well, you get the idea.<p>
As a last little note, this initial documentation here should be removed. If we see it, we will deduct points. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Fri Aug 29 15:20:26 2003 for 15-410 Project 1 by
