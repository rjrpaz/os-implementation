<H1>PIOS: Parallel Instructional Operating System</H1>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
The time of uniprocessor machines
working alone or in loosely coupled configurations is over.
The time of massively parallel multicore machines
working in tightly coupled data center clusters is here.
It is time for undergraduate operating system courses
to catch up to this reality,
and expose students to the multicore and cluster
OS concepts and programming practices they will need
in today's and tomorrow's industry and research positions.
This is the goal of
<i>PIOS&mdash;Parallel Instructional Operating System</i>.

<p>
PIOS is based on <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/">JOS</a> from MIT,
but its core kernel, user-space runtime, and programming assignments
were redesigned and rewritten
by <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/people/ford.html">Bryan Ford</a>
at <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/">Yale</a>
to emphasize parallel and distributed OS concepts and programming techniques.
To the author's knowledge,
PIOS represents the first instructional OS and curriculum
in which students build a working multiprocessor, distributed OS,
which runs on real multicore PCs,
in a one-semester undergraduate-level course.
The author used PIOS to teach
Yale's <a href=".">CS422: Operating Systems</a> course in Spring 2010,
during which all twelve students (about half undergraduate, half graduate),
working in teams of 2&ndash;3,
successfully reimplemented all of PIOS's core components,
then added features of their own design such as
lazy cross-node address space migration, VGA graphics,
and booting from USB on their own laptops.

<p>
Since PIOS has been used only one year so far,
it is still in an early, experimental state,
and will continue to evolve in subsequent years.
But adventurous OS instructors are welcome to give it a try,
and feedback and improvements are welcome.

<h3>PIOS Design Overview</h3>

<img border="0" src="images/spaces.png" align="right" />

PIOS consists of a boot loader, a microkernel,
a user-space runtime embedded in a minimal C library,
and a set of sample applications,
all sliced into subsets forming an instructional curriculum as described below.
The PIOS microkernel implements only four system calls
(one only for debugging),
and supervises
a hierarchy of single-threaded, &ldquo;shared-nothing&rdquo; address spaces,
as illustrated in the figure at right.
User-level code in these spaces
execute in parallel on multiple CPUs or multiple nodes in a cluster,
synchronizing and communicating in a simple parent/child rendezvous
and virtual memory copy model.
The kernel extends its API across distributed clusters,
&ldquo;mostly transparently,&rdquo;
by migrating a user-level space cross-node
when it needs to rendezvous with a space on a different node.

<p>
Despite the kernel API's minimality,
PIOS's user-space runtime builds atop it
a number of familiar Unix abstractions
such as fork/wait process management,
console I/O, a logically shared file system,
and shared-memory multithreading.
In doing so, the design of PIOS's runtime
introduces students
not only to conventional operating abstractions
such as files, I/O, and user-space shells,
but also to some advanced distributed systems techniques
such as weakly-consistent state replication
and distributed shared memory.
PIOS is actually a subset of, and was designed concurrently with,
<a href="http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/det/">Determinator</a>,
a research OS for deterministic execution of parallel applications.


<h3>Instructional Curriculum</h3>

Like JOS,
the instructor's version of PIOS contains scripts
to &ldquo;slice&rdquo; the reference solution into pieces
forming a progressive set of OS skeletons,
one for each of five programming labs,
in which students fill in key components omitted from the skeleton code.
Supplied automatic test scripts can also aid in grading.
The instructor can adjust the amount of code
supplied to the students in the skeleton
versus the amount the students must write themselves&mdash;and
hence the difficulty of the programming assignments&mdash;by
inserting or removing &lsquo;<tt>#ifdef</tt>&rsquo;s
in the PIOS reference code.
The labs are currently organized as follows:

<ul>
<li>	<a href="2010/lab1/">Lab 1: Initializing PC Hardware</a>:
	booting the kernel, printing to the console, understanding the stack,
	handling processor traps, privilege levels, protected control transfer,
	and page-based physical memory allocation.
<li>	<a href="2010/lab2/">Lab 2: Processes and Synchronization</a>:
	using spinlocks in a multiprocessor kernel,
	scheduling processes on physical CPU cores,
	system calls for user-space process management and synchronization,
	preemption, and trap reflection.
<li>	<a href="2010/lab3/">Lab 3: Virtual Memory</a>:
	managing x86 page tables, loading ELF executables,
	system call argument copyin/copyout,
	virtual memory management with copy-on-write and merge.
<li>	<a href="2010/lab4/">Lab 4: Files and I/O</a>:
	emulating a Unix file API in user space,
	console input/output,
	Unix-style fork/exec and command-line arguments,
	file system reconciliation between processes.
<li>	<a href="2010/lab5/">Lab 5: Cluster Computing</a>:
	PCI and E100 network device drivers,
	process state migration across nodes,
	address space migration.
</ul>

In CS422 at Yale, students have about two weeks for each lab
(three weeks for lab 3),
and &ldquo;Lab 6&rdquo; is a student-chosen final project.
