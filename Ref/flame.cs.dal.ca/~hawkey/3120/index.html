<h4>Assignments</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href = "Assign1.htm">Assignment 1 - Due 1:35 pm, Friday, May 23</a>
<ul><li><a href = "makefile">Sample makefile for this assignment.</a>
    <li><a href = "http://www.gnu.org/manual/make/html_chapter/make_toc.html">Reference material on makefiles</a>
    <li>NOTE: If you edit the file, be very careful of leading white
space on a line. Make expects TAB characters
not spaces at the start of any line that is a command to be executed.
All other lines need to start in column one without white space. If you cut and paste the text of the sample makefile into an editor, you may unwittingly end up with spaces instead of tabs.
    <li>TO SUBMIT:  create a directory called assignment_1 and place README, test.txt, makefile, mychild.h, mychild.c, myshell.h, and myshell.c in the directory.  In the directory above assignment_1, type: submit assignment_1 <br> Select cs3120 from the available options and the submit will take place.  You should get a SUCCEEDED message that will tell you that all 7 files were successfuly submitted.  You may submit more than once and your latest submission will be the one that is marked.  Once 1:35 pm, Friday, May 23rd has passed, the submit program will mark your submission as late and the marker will not mark it.  Remember to pass in the hard copies of your files at the beginning of class on Friday.
