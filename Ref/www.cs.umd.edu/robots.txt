# AGGGGGHH! records are separated by new lines (they are not ignored)
# shucks, darn, and other niceties
#
# Comments about this webserver would be greatly appreciated.  Send to
# webmaster@cs.umd.edu.  Poetry will be burned.
#
# Note: deleted uses whose URLs have been redirected to the deleted script
# don't need to remain here - the script returns an ENOTFOUND 404 error.
# And that should be sufficient for a web robot to ignore it.
