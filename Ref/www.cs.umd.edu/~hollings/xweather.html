<P>
This is the program xweather which is derived from wxmap written by Charley 
Kline.  To use this program you need a weather feed and the weather server.
To see a sample of how the program works you can connect to a "dummy" server
on poona.cs.wisc.edu (port 612).  This contains sample data a single hour.
Text reports are not avaible from this server.
<P>
You will also need to set the libDirectory resource to the correct location.
For testing, you can run the program out of this directory and use the 
following command line.
<pre>
    xweather -xrm "*libDirectory: ." -xrm "*serverHost: poona.cs.wisc.edu"
</pre>
<p>
You will want to install the application default file Xweather in your
app default directory.

To get a weather feed contact Zephyr Weather Information Service (508-898-3511).
