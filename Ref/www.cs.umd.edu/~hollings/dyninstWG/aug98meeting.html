The meeting will start at 8:30 (breakfast starting at 8:00) in the St. Andrews
Room.

<pre>
1.  Legal Issues
    a.  Do we have all the legal issues covered as far as sharing
	intellectual property is concerned?
	i.  Does everyone understand what we have in place and why 
	    it is needed?

    c.  The IBM authored JPA:
	i.  Complete control over what information an organization
	    contributes
	ii. Unrestricted access to what others contribute
	iii.Fully paid, unrestricted, royalty free, perpetual license to
	    sell, distribute, publish, use, create derivative works from any
	    contribution to the project
	iv. Legal reassurance that each organization has the right to
	    contribute any material it contributes

2.  DynInst API
    a.  *brief* discussion of longterm role of dyninstAPI vs. DPCL
	- UMD/Wisconsin continues to release code to it
	- IBM is extending it, and using it to build DPCL.
	
    b. status update from UMD on next release (features and timetable)

    b. instrumentation at arbitrary points
	- proposed interface from UMD (with AIX implementation ready)
	- does it meet the needs of the UT/IBM Toool effort?

    c. sub-procedure level instrumentation
	- abstractions
	- loop and statement instrumentation points
	- proposal from IBM for new functions

    d. control flow graph
	- why is this needed?
	- proposed functions from IBM

    e. BPatch_sourceObj
	- proposal from IBM for parent class for BPatch_image, BPatch_module

    f. Type System
	- current API is very weak here
	- debuggers need this type of information
	- proposals from IBM for additional type methods
	- cross language issues (common blocks, virtual methods, etc.)
	
3. DPCL
    a.  status update (beta has shipped)

    b.  debugging features
	    need for additional features

    d.  Players need time to absorb what's in the beta...

4.  Involvement Issues
    a.  We want labs, vendors, universities and ISVs to have a say in and be
	involved with DynInst and DPCL, or at least DPCL.

    b.  What obstacles exist that prevent players from being involved?  
	Is it:
	    i.  Preemption by higher priority concerns (e.g., Cray)?
	    ii. Lack of information?
	    iii.Lack of human or other resources?
	    iv. Do the goals of DynInst/DPCL conflict with the goals of the
		organization (e.g., Dolphin)?

    c.  What would it take for venders to become interested in porting 
	DPCL to their platforms and using it in products?

    d.  What would it take for labs to use and endorse DPCL?

    e.  What kinds of incentives are needed?

5.  Next Meeting
	SC'98?
