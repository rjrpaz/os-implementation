<h1>Instructions for setting up Tau/Ceti (CMSC 714)</h1>

<h2>1. Login</h2>
<p>You can login to tau.umiacs.umd.edu with your class account (cs714xx). The remaining steps differ depending on whether you are in a software engineering study.
</p>

<h2>2. If you are participating in the study (do once)</h2>
<p>
Your environment (paths) will be automatically set up with the following steps. Please do not modify it. If you have any questions, please contact hpcs-issues@cs.umd.edu.
</p>
<ol>
<li>You should have already created an account for the study system in the previous assignment. If you have, go to the next step. Otherwise, visit <a href="http://care.cs.umd.edu:8080/umdexpt/cgi-bin/index.cgi">this page</a> and click "enroll HERE". Enter your name, class ID "CMSC714F06", email address, and account name of your choice. You will receive email containing the login password and a "Hackystat key", which you need in the next step.</li>
<li>Login to tau, and run the following command<pre>
% /user/nakamura/umdinst/bin/instrument {hackystat_key}
</pre>where {hackystat_key} is your Haskystat key. It may take a few minutes until the setup process is completed.</li>
<li>Log out, and log in again. (If you see an error message when your log out for the first time, that's normal.)</li>
</ol>
