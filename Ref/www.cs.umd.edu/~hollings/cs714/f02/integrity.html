<P>
All work that you submit in this course must be your own; 
unauthorized group efforts will be be considered academic dishonesty.  
See the <em> Undergraduate Catalog</em> for definitions and sanctions.
<b> 
Academic dishonesty is a serious offense which may result
in suspension or expulsion from the University.
</b>
In addition to any other action taken, such as suspension or expulsion, the 
grade ``XF'' denoting ``failure due to academic dishonesty'' will
normally be recorded on the transcripts of students found responsible
for acts of academic dishonesty.
<P>
Students are encouraged to report academic dishonesty.
Dial 314-8206 and ask for the the ``Campus Advocate.''
<P>
You may discuss homework in a general way with other students, but you may
not consult any one else's written work.
Any similarity in form or notation between submissions with
different authors will be regarded as evidence of academic dishonesty
-- so protect your work.  
<P>
Sharing of code on programming assignments is a form of academic dishonesty.
For assembly language programming assignments, writing your program in a
high level language and turning in the output of a compiler will be considered
academic dishonesty (The output of a compiler is easy to recognize).
