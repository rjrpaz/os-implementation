through.

my wife and the other is my lover".
<p>
The second man agrees to go up and ask them to play though, but soon returns
and reports "Small world, I have the same problem."

A fellow comes home after golf one Sunday afternoon, falls asleep on
the couch, and doesn't wake up until about 9 PM. His wife asks why
he is so tired. "Well, You remember George, my golfing buddy?
He died today, on the fourth green."
<p>
"That's terrible," she says. "It sure was," he says, 
"For the next 14 holes it was drive, drag George, chip, drag George, putt, 
drag George..."

A hack golfer spends a day at a plush country club, playing golf,
enjoying the luxury of a complimentary caddy. Being a hack golfer, he plays
poorly all day. Round about the 18th hole, he spots a lake off to
the left of the fairway. He looks at the caddy and says,
"I've played so poorly all day; I think I'm going to go drown myself in that
lake. "The caddy looks back at him and says, "I don't think you could keep
your head down that long."

Bill was 26 over par by the eighth hole; he had landed a fleet of golf
balls in the water hazard, and dug himself into a trench fighting his
way out of the rough. When his caddy coughed during a 12-inch putt,
Bill exploded. "You've got to be the worst caddy in the world!" he
screamed. "I doubt it," replied the caddy. "That would be too much of a
coincidence."

A foursome is waiting at the men's tee when another foursome of ladies
are hitting from the ladies tee. The ladies are taking their time and
when finally the last one is ready to hit the ball she hacks it about
10 feet. She goes over to the ball, hacks it another ten feet and looks
up at the men waiting and says apologetically: "I guess all those
fucking lessons I took this winter didn't help." 
<P>
One of the men immediately replies: "No, you see there is your problem. 
You should have been taking golf lessons instead."

I was playing this hole one time with a senior citizen and just as he was about ready to hit his tee shot he noticed a funeral procession approaching. He took
off his hat, put it over his heart, and stood silently and watched the procession go by until it disappeared. 
<br>
I said, "That's really nice of you. Do you always do that when a funeral goes by?
<br>
He said "No, not usually, but I it's the least I could do in this case. I was married to the woman for 40 years!"

A rather good golf junkie who happens to be a priest is on the 18th
hole and has about a 200 yard approach shot to the green. He drags out
his 1-iron, and starts to swing at the ball. Suddenly, the clouds
overhead let out a flash of lightning and a massive roll of thunder,
shattering a tree some 3 hundred yards east, and the rain begins
pouring down in a blinding sheet.
<p>
The distraction causes him to hook the shot badly out of bounds. He
waves his 1-iron at the clouds, screaming and yelling and cursing God.
His caddy runs up, grabs his club arm and yanks it down, yelling ``Are
you crazy? You don't wave a club around like that in a thunderstorm!''
The priest looks at his caddy and says
<p>
``Phhhhhtt. Not even God can hit a 1-iron!''.

A guy stood over his tee shot for what seemed an eternity, looking up,
looking down, measuring the distance, figuring the wind direction and
speed... driving his partner nuts.
<p>
Finally his exasperated partner says, "What the hell is taking so long?
Hit the damned ball!"
<p>
The guy answers, "My wife is up there watching me from the clubhouse.
I want to make this a perfect shot."
<p>
"Give me a break!  You don't stand a snowball's chance in hell of
hitting her from here."

Four guys who worked together always golfed as a group at 7:00 a.m. on
Sunday.  Unfortunately, one of them got transferred out of town and
they were talking about trying to fill out the foursome. 
<p>
A woman standing near the tee said, "Hey, I like to golf, can I join
the group?" They were hesitant, but said she could come once to try it
and they could see what they thought. They all agreed and she said,
"Good, I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45." She showed up right at 6:30,
and wound up setting a course record with a 7-under par round. The
guys went nuts and everyone in the clubhouse congratulated her.
Meanwhile, she was fun and pleasant the entire round.  The guys
happily invited her back the next week and she said "Sure, I'll be
here at 6:30 or 6:45." 
<p>
Again, she showed up at 6:30 Sunday morning.  Only this time, she
played left-handed, and matched her 7-under par score of the previous
week.  By now the guys were totally amazed, and they asked her to join
the group for keeps. 
<p>
They had a beer after their round, and one of the guys asked her, "How
do you decide if you're going to golf  right-handed or left-handed?"
She said, "That's easy.  Before I leave for the golf course, I pull
the covers off my husband, who sleeps in the nude. If his member is
pointing to the right, I golf right-handed; if it's pointed to the
left, I golf left-handed." 
<p>
One of the guys asked, "What if it's pointed straight up?" She said,
"Then I'll be here at 6:45."

A man who was an avid golfer finally got a once in a lifetime
chance for an audience with the Pope.  After standing in line
for hours, he got to the Pope and said, "Holiness, I have a
question that only you can answer. You see, I love golf, and I
feel a real need to know if there is a golf course in heaven.
Can you tell me if there is?"
<p>
The Pope considered for a moment, and replied, "I do not know
the answer to your question, my son, but I will talk to God and
get back with you."
<p>
The next day, the man is called for another audience with the
Pope to receive the answer to his question. He stood before the
Pope, who said, "My son, I have some good news and some bad
news in relation to your question. The good news is that heaven
has the most fabulous golf course that you could imagine and is
in eternally perfect shape. It puts all courses on earth to
shame .... 
<p>
"The bad news is that you have a tee time for tomorrow
morning."

Once the club duffer challenged the local golf pro to a match, with a
$100 bet on the side.  "But," said the duffer, "since you're obviously
much better then I, to even it a bit you have to spot me two
'gotchas.'"  
<p>
The golf pro didn't know what a 'gotcha' was, but he went along with
it.  
<p>
And off they went. Coming back to the 19th hole, the rest of the
club members were amazed to see the golf pro paying the duffer $100. 
<p>
"What happened?" asked one of the members.  
<p>
"Well, "said the pro.  "l was teeing up for the first hole, and as l
brought the club down, the jerk stuck his hand between my legs and
grabbed my balls while yelling "Gotcha!"  
<p>
Have you ever tried to play 18 holes of golf waiting for the second
'gotcha?'"

After a particularly poor game of golf, a popular club member skipped
the clubhouse and started to go home. As he was walking to the
parking lot to get his car, a policeman stopped him and asked, "Did
you tee off on the sixteenth hole about twenty minutes ago?"
<p>
"Yes," the golfer responded.
<p>
"Did you happen to hook your ball so that it went over the trees and
off the course?"
<p>
"Yes, I did. How did you know?" he asked.
<p>
"Well," said the policeman very seriously, "Your ball flew out onto
the highway and crashed through a driver's windshield. The car went
out of control, crashing into five other cars and a fire truck. The
fire truck couldn't make it to the fire, and the building burned down.
So, what are you going to do about it?"
<p>
The golfer thought it over carefully and responded . . .
<p>
"I think I'll close my stance a little bit, tighten my grip and lower
my right thumb."
<hr>
A golfer is in a competitive match with a friend, who is ahead by a
couple of strokes.  The golfer says to himself,  "I'd give anything
to sink this next putt."
<p>
A stranger walks up to him and whispers, "Would you give up a fourth
of your sex life?"
<p>
The golfer thinks the man is crazy and that his answer will be
meaningless. At the same time he thinks this might be a good omen,
so he says, "Okay," and sinks the putt.  Two holes later he mumbles
to himself, "Boy, if I could only  get an eagle on this hole."
<p>
The same stranger moves to his side and says, "Would it be worth
another fourth of your sex life?"
<p>
The golfer shrugs and says, "Sure."  He makes an eagle. On the final
hole, the golfer needs yet another eagle to win. Though he says
nothing, the stranger moves to his side and says, "Would you be
willing to give up the rest of your sex life to win this match?"
<p>
The golfer says, "Certainly!"  He makes the eagle.
<p>
As the golfer walks to the club house, the stranger walks alongside
and says, "You know, I've really not been fair  with you because you
don't know who I am. I'm the devil, and from now on you will have no
sex life."
<p>
"Nice to meet you," says the golfer.  "My name's... Father O'Malley."
<hr>
Why do they call it golf?
<p>
Because all the other four-letter words are taken.
