This page contains information relating to the Course 818H on tools for
parallel computing offered during the Sping 1995 semester.

This seminar will investigate the state of the art in tools to assist
programmers with debugging parallel programs for performance and 
correctness.  We will also discuss several parallel programming languages 
including: PVM, Linda, and HPF.  Topics will include: Performance 
Visualization, Performance Tuning Systems, Instrumentation Techniques, 
Performance Prediction, Parallel Debuggers, Global Breakpoint Detection, 
Race Detection, and Program Steering.
