<P>
Golf is a wonderfully frustrating game.  When not writing grant
proposals or papers, I sometimes attempt to play the game.

Two
courses that I enjoy playing are:
<H2><A HREF="http://courseguide.golfweb.com/ocdata.cgi/detail?gwid=7648">
University of Maryland</A>
(<A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hollings/golf/umdGolf.jpg" >Bird's Eye View of Course</A>)
</H2>

<P>
University Blvd,  College Park, MD, 20740

This course is just off campus.  It's a nice course, and not too
long.  They have been working on the course over the last few
years adding cart paths and additional traps not shown in the bird's 
eye view.
A new club house opened in 1999.
<H2><A HREF="http://courseguide.golfweb.com/ocdata.cgi/detail?gwid=7742">
Sligo Park Golf Course</A>
(<A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hollings/golf/sligoGolf.jpg" >Bird's Eye View</A>)
</H2>

<P>
9701 Sligo Creek Pkwy, Silver Spring, MD, 20901 
<P>
This is a nice little 9 hole course.  The greens are in OK, but
not great shape.  The last six holes crisscross the stream that
runs through the course. The lake added to the 9th a few years
ago made the most difficult hole a bit harder.
9<SUP>th</SUP> hole.<BR>
