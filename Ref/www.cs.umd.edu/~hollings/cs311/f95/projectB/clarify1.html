<H1>Clarification on grading of the Project</H1>

<P>
The overall project is worth 15% of your grade.
The first part of the project is worth 2% of your overall grade in the class.
The second part of the project is worth 13% of your grade. 
For the second part, it will be possible to receive partial credit even 
if your program does not fully work.  
We will grade the projects using s set of test cases.
Each test case will be worth some number of points.  
If a program fails a test case, you will only lose the points for that
test case.
About one half of the project grade will be for coding style, comments, and
following the directions about the number of and types of subroutines you
write.
<P>
Submitting the output of a high level language compiler will result in a 
project grade of 0.  
Don't even think about this! 
You are much better off turning in a partially working program!
