<LI>From Mano 2-12.
<LI>From Mano 2-15.
<LI>From Mano 2-18.
<LI>Convert the following decimal (base 10) numbers to binary:
<OL>
<LI>47
<LI>19
<LI>255
<LI>1024
<LI>0
</OL>

<LI>Convert the following hexadecimal numbers to binary and then
to octal:
<OL>
<LI>3F2
<LI>77
<LI>3F
<LI>101
<LI>A
</OL>

<LI>Perform the following additions by first converting the decimal
numbers to 8-bit two's complement notation, and then adding. If
the addition results in an overflow condition (assuming the addends
and result are stored in 8-bit registers), indicate that an overflow
exists.
<OL>
<LI>26 +45
<LI>30 + 100
<LI>-41 + (-99)
<LI>45 + (-52)
<LI>(-91) + 117
</OL>

<LI>Design a circuit to convert the three-bit Gray code to the
standard binary code. For example, if the input to the circuit
is 111, the output should be 101, since 111 is the Gray code representation
of 5, while 101 is the standard binary representation of 5.
