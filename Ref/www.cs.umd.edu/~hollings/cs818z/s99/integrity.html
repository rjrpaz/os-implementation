normally be recorded on the transcripts of students found responsible
for acts of academic dishonesty.

Dial 314-8206 and ask for the the ``Campus Advocate.''

You may discuss homework in a general way with other students, but you may
not consult any one else's written work.
Any similarity in form or notation between submissions with
different authors will be regarded as evidence of academic dishonesty
-- so protect your work.
