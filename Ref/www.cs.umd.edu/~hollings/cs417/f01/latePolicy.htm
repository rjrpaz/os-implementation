<h2>CMSC417 - Computer Networks</h2>
<h2> Late Policy</h2>
</center>
<P>
The late policy for CMSC417 (Fall 2001) is that no late programming
assignments or design documents will be accepted.  If you are unable to 
complete a
programming assignment due to illness or family emergency, please
see Dr. Hollingsworth as soon as possible to make special arrangements.
