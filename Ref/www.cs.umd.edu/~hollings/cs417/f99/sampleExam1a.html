(15 points) Define or explain the following terms:
<P>
count to infinity problem
<P>
packet
<P>
virtual circuit vs. packet switched
<P>
ISDN
<P>
flooding
<P>
(15 points) Consider using a 4khz channel and 16 discrete levels
to send data.
<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>What is the maximum possible transmission rate
if the channel is noiseless? </FONT>
<LI>What if the signal to noise ratio is 30dB?
</OL>
<P>
(15 Points) A cellular phone system needs to accommodate many
users. Explain how the system uses space, frequency, and time
division multiplexing.
<P>
(20 Points) List the seven layers of the ISO/OSI reference model
and for each layer provide an example of a function commonly performed
at that layer.
<P>
(20 points) Consider routing in a network with 200 routers, and
on average every router is connected to 4 other routers. Routing
information is exchanged every 100msec. How much network bandwidth
is used under link-state and distance vector routing to exchange
this information. Assume sequence numbers are used to damp flood
packets for link-state. Please explain any assumptions you make
about the size of routing table entries.
<P>
 (15 points) In a broadcast channel, link bandwidth is wasted
due to multiple hosts trying to send at once and canceling each
others communication. A simple model of this problem is that time
is divided into discrete slots. If a network has n hosts, and
the probability of any single host trying to use a slot is p,
what fraction of slots are wasted due to collisions?
