CMSC417 FTP Application README
</h1>
</center>
<P>
The FTP application is both a client and a server.  Each copy spawns a thread
for the server and one for the client command line prompt.  In addition, each
active connection results in a thread being created.
<P>
To compile this application, you need to collect your network and session
code into a UNIX archive file.  To create an archive file, add the
following lines to your project Makefile:
<P>
<pre>
libcmsc417.a: <all of your .o files>
	ar crv libcmsc417.a $?
</pre>
<P>
You then need to set the NETWORK macro in the Makefile to be the path to your
libcmsc417.a file.  For example ../network/libcmsc417.a. 
<P>
