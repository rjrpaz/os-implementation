the following terms:</FONT>

to be accepted as part of a current connection. Caused by node
crashes or sequence number wrap around.</I></FONT>

between producers and consumers.  Can be done at the link or network
layers.</I></FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">two army problem: <I>explains the
problem of communicating over an unreliable network.  The problem
is that two parties can never know if the last message sent was
correctly received.  This problem relates to deleting a connection

<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">let n = m + r, m is the message length,
r is the number of error recovery bits. To be able to recover
from a d bit error we need to have n choose d invalid messages
for every valid message.  n choose d is the number of ways you
can flip exactly d bits in an n bit message. There are 2<I><SUP>m</SUP>
valid messages so:  [(n choose d) + 1] 2<SUP>m</SUP> &lt;=2 <SUP>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">If the ratio of error detection
bits to payload bits remains constant, what are the tradeoffs

a block of characters?</FONT>

hosts is by assigning a host a temporary IP address in its new
location, <B>and</B> continuing to use its old address by tunneling
IP through IP back to an agent running on the mobile host's home
network.</FONT>

the transfer, not forward each packet</FONT></I>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">When tunneling IP through IP, it
is not possible to always maintain a one for one match between
tunneled packets and the native packet. Why?  Explain the potential
performance implications of this limitation.</FONT>
</OL>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Tunneled packet needs an IP header
and if the packet to tunnel is already at the MTU for the network,
the extra size will require it to be fragmented.  Fragmentation
will slow down the network due to extra overhead of processing
two packets and the need to re-transmit all parts of a fragment
if one is lost.</FONT></I>
<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"> (15 Points) IP Addresses</FONT>
<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The Internet is running out of IP
addresses to assign, but there are substantially less than four
billion hosts on the Internet.  Explain why this is happening.</FONT>
</OL>
</OL>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Internal fragment due to IP addresses
being assigned in blocks rather than one at a time.</FONT></I>
<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Joe Hacker reads about IPv6  (with
128 bit address) and is concerned about routing table size.  He
decides that the best solution is to encode latitude and longitude
into IP addresses. Explain how this might be used to reduce routing
table size.  Provide a reason why this might not reduce routing
table size. </FONT>
</OL>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Geographic information could be used
as the basis of hierarchical routing.  Nodes would store detailed
routing information for its local region and only sparse information
for distant nodes.  The problem is that due to administrative
domains and different ISP's physical location is not equivalent
to nearest neighbor for routing purposes.</FONT></I>
<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"> (15 Points) Consider a network
where on average, messages between two hosts must travel through
10 routers (and thus 11 hops).  On average, one packet in every
1,000 is lost as is passes through a router.</FONT>
<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">If one packet in 100 is garbled
per hop, what is the probability of a packet making it through
the network if no link level re-transmission is used?  What if
link-level re-transmission is used?</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">(15 points)  Congestion Control</FONT>
<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Why is congestion control more important
in a network carrying traffic whose bandwidth requirements vary
dynamically during a session compared with fixed bandwidth traffic?</FONT>
</OL>
</OL>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">With static traffic, congestion avoidance
via call admission can be used.  With dynamic traffic, call admission
leads to under utilization of the network due to conservative
allocation choices.</FONT></I>
<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">In TCP (Jacobson) congestion control,
the variance in round-trip times for packets implicitly influences
the congestion window.  Explain how a high variation in the round-trip
time affects the congestion window.  What is the impact of this
high variation on the throughput for a single connection?</FONT>
</OL>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">With all other things being the same
(i.e. losses and congestion), high variance in RTT will lead to
a long timeouts for re-tranmission.  This will make congestion
detection slower since we only close the window when a packet
is dropped (detected via a timeout).  As a result, it is more
likely the network will get into a congested state, this will
reduce the throughput of our connection.<BR>
