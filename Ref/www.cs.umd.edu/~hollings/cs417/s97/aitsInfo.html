aITs Unix cluster systems
</H1>
</center>

<p>
The aITs Unix cluster systems (details below) share a common file
system, common news and mail systems, and common users.
This means
users can login to whichever of the systems they want and their same
login id and password will work and their files will be available.
This also means users can do their own "load balancing" by logging in
to whichever system seems to be best for them at the time.

<h2>System Details</h2> 
<p>
The cluster machines are as follows:

<p>
<menu>
<Table border>
<TR VALIGN="bottom"><FONT FACE="Arial">
<tr> <td> Alpha Systems </td> </td>
<tr> <td> marlowe.umd.edu </td> </td>
<tr> <td> marple.umd.edu </td> </td>
<tr> <td> tracy.umd.edu </td> </td>
<tr> <td> wolfe.umd.edu </td> </td>
<tr> <td> holmes.umd.edu </td> </td>
</table>
</menu>

<p>
All mail sent to the cluster should be addressed to
<login-id>@umd5.umd.edu (which is the address that is placed on all
outgoing cluster mail). Mail sent in this manner can be read from any
cluster system. The machine known as umd5.umd.edu is also part of the
cluster but acts as a server for the cluster. <b>DO NOT USE UMD5</b> for
anything other than your EMAIL address.  
Never login to umd5.
<p>
Games, IRC, and MUDs are not allowed on the aITs Unix cluster.
<p>
The  home directories contain default .login, .cshrc, and .logout
files.  In addition, the access mode on the home directories has  been
set  to 700.  This means that a student will not be able to copy files
from an unsuspecting student, unless the owner changes the mode of his
home directory to something  that  allows  such  access.    Of  course
students can still MAIL things to each other.
<p>
User  files  are  NFS mounted on various servers.  Symbolic links
are used to create the file names found in the system  password  file.
This  means  the  names  returned by the pwd command may not match the
names found in the system password file.  Users should always refer to
home directories by the ~loginid or $HOME methods.
<p>
The estimated enrollment for your  class  was  used  to  generate
login ids for you, your students and TAs.  All login ids have the same
attributes;  you  and  your TAs can select any of the ids for your own
use.  The details of these login ids are listed at  the  end  of  this
MAIL item.
<p>

access, you should contact:

<h2> Ethics</h2>

<p>
University of Maryland at College Park
<p>
Guidelines for the Acceptable Use of Computing Resources
<p>

<p>
Primary Principles: Freedom of Expression and Personal Responsibility

<p>
Freedom of expression and an open environment to pursue scholarly
inquiry and for sharing of information are encouraged, supported, and
protected at the University of Maryland at College Park ("UMCP").
These values lie at the core of our academic community. Censorship is
not compatible with the tradition and goals of the University. While
some computer resources may be dedicated to specific research,
teaching, or administrative tasks that would limit their use, freedom
of expression must, in general, be protected. The University does not
limit access to information due to its content when it meets the
standard of legality. UMCP's policy of freedom of expression applies
to computer resources.

<p>
Concomitant with free expression are personal obligations of each
member of our community to use computer resources responsibly,
ethically, and in a manner which accords both with the law and the
rights of others. The campus depends first upon a spirit of mutual
respect and cooperation to create and maintain an open community of
responsible users.

<p>
<h3>General</h3>

<p>
These guidelines set forth standards for responsible and acceptable
use of UMCP computer resources. They supplement existing UMCP
policies, agreements, and state and federal laws and regulations.
Computer resources include host computer systems, UMCP-sponsored
computers and workstations, communications networks, software, and
files.

<p>
Computing resources are provided to support the academic research,
instructional, and administrative objectives of the University. These
resources are extended for the sole use of University faculty, staff,
students, and other authorized users ("users") to accomplish tasks
related to the user's status at UMCP, and consistent with UMCP's
mission.

<p>
Users are responsible for safeguarding their identification (ID) codes
and passwords, and for using them for their intended purposes only.
Each user is responsible for all transactions made under the
authorization of his or her ID, and for all network activity
originating from his or her data jack.

<p>
Violation of these guidelines constitutes unacceptable use of computer
resources, and may violate other University policies and/or state and
federal law. Suspected or known violations should be reported to the
appropriate UMCP computing unit. Violations will be processed by the
appropriate UMCP authorities and/or law enforcement agencies.
Violations may result in revocation of computer resource privileges,
academic dishonesty or Honor Council proceedings, faculty, staff or
student disciplinary action, or legal action.

<h3> User Responsibilities</h3>

<p>
The following provisions describe conduct prohibited under these
guidelines:

<menu>
<li>
Altering system software or hardware configurations, or disrupting
     or interfering with the delivery or administration of computer
     resources.

<li>
  Attempting to access or accessing another's account,
     private files, or e-mail without the owner's permission; or
     misrepresenting oneself as another individual in electronic
     communication.

<li>
  Installing, copying, distributing or using software
     in violation of: copyright and/or software agreements; applicable
     state and federal laws; or the principles described in Using Software,
     A Guide to the Ethical and Legal Use of Software for Members of the
     Academic Community, available on inforM.

  
<li>
  Using computing resources to engage in conduct which interferes
     with others' use of shared computer resources and/or the activities
     of other users, including studying, teaching, research, and
     University administration.

<li>
  Using computing resources for commercial or profit-making purposes
     without written authorization from the University.

<li>
  Failing to adhere to individual departmental or unit lab and system
     policies, procedures, and protocols.

<li>
  Allowing access to computer resources by unauthorized users.

<li>
  Using computer resources for illegal activities. Criminal and illegal
     use may include obscenity, child pornography, threats, harassment,
     theft, and unauthorized access.
</menu>

<h3>Administration</h3>

<p>
The maintenance, operation, and security of computing resources
require responsible UMCP personnel to monitor and access the system.
To the extent possible in the electronic environment and in a public
setting, a user's privacy will be preserved. Nevertheless, that
privacy is subject to the Maryland Access to Public Records Act, other
applicable state and federal laws, and the needs of the University to
meet its administrative, business, and legal obligations.

<h2>  System Access  </h2>

<p>
     The  only  access  to  the  aITs  Unix  systems is via the campus
network.

<p>
     WAM  (Workstations  At  Maryland)  workstations,  such  as  those
located  in  CSS  room  3330,  are  directly  connected  to the campus
network.  Directions for using WAM workstations can be found  in  each
workstation  laboratory and in the aITs Information Technology Library
(CSS West Wing room 1400).

<h2> Consulting  </h2>
<p>
     Academic Information Technology Services provides  First-Aid  and
general consulting services to those who use Unix computing systems on
campus.   aITs Unix machines run the Ultrix version of Unix.  With the
realization that there are  other  versions  of  Unix  being  used  on
campus, First-Aid and Consulting Services will address questions based
on their experience with the aITs Unix systems.
<p>
     Your  students  should  use the First-Aid service (located in all
WAM workstation laboratories).    They  may  also  use  the  First-Aid
Hotline  for  phone-in  questions  (405-6941),  which  is  answered by
First-Aiders in the PGII WAM lab.
<p>
     Exact hours of service are posted at each First-Aid station.
<p>
     University faculty, staff,  graduate  researchers,  and  teaching
assistants can use the following consulting services.
<p>
          Consulting  on  a walk-in or phone-in basis in the
          Consulting Lab (CSS West  Wing  room  1400,  phone
          (301)  405-1500),  8:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m., Monday -
          Friday during the Fall  and  Spring  semesters  (9
          a.m.  -  4:30  p.m. during semester breaks and the
          Summer semester).
<p>
          Electronic mail at  any  time;  use  the  Internet
          address   
	  <a href = "mailto:consult@umail.umd.edu">
	  consult@umail.umd.edu</a>. 
	  Questions are answered by a member of the  Consulting  staff  at
          the  earliest  possible opportunity.   The consult
          command has been added to the aITs Unix systems to
          make sending mail easier, just  type  consult  and
          follow the directions.
<p>
     The aITs Information Technology Library (CSS West Wing room 1400)
has  reference  copies of Unix manuals and documentation for your use.
The Library also sells "Introduction to the aITs UNIX  Systems"  (aITs
Unix handout number 1).

<h2>  News  </h2>

<p>
     Academic  Information  Technology  Services  uses the Usenet news
system on its Unix systems to inform users about system  outages,  new
software,  etc.    The news group csc.news is used for all news items.
Items that are  considered  of  interest  to  the  general  University
community are also placed in the um.general news group.
<p>
     The  default .login file contains a call to the readnews program.
On some systems, users prefer to use the rn program to read news.   If
rn  is  used,  the  call to readnews should be removed from the users'
.login file.

<h2> Printing  </h2>
<p>
     aITs has replaced the stock lpr program with a shell script  that
calls  MDQS  to  print  a file on prl, which is the 3800 laser printer
attached to the campus UMDD IBM system.
<p>
     The call is   lpr <file>   to initiate printing of file <file>.
<p>
     Output may be retrieved at the aITs dispatch counter on the first
floor of the CSS building.

<h2> File Recovery </h2>
<p>
     A dump of all files is taken every week.  These file backups  are
for recovery from catastrophic loss.  Individual user file recovery is
not available at this time.

                  <h2>  Passwords  </h2>
<p>
     Unix  systems do not have the concept of an account manager; this
means that if a user forgets his password, aITs must change it for the
user.
<p>
     Requests for change of password should be made to Ira Gold at the
address above.   Requests to change student  passwords  will  only  be
honored  when  they  are made by the instructor.  Instructors can make
such requests via electronic mail.  Requests must include login id and
system name.

                  <h2>  Disk Quota  </h2>
<p>
     All user login ids on the aITs Unix systems  have  a  disk  quota
associated  with them.  When the disk quota is exceeded, the user will
not be able to create new files until the amount of disk space in  use
has been reduced, or the disk quota has been increased.
<p>
     Requests  for  change of disk quota should be made to Ira Gold at
the address above.  Requests to change student disk quotas  will  only
be honored when they are made by the instructor.  Instructors can make
such  requests  via electronic mail.   Requests must include login id,
desired new disk quota (expressed in kilobytes), and system name.   In
all  cases,  requests for higher disk quotas will be evaluated against
system resources and system load.
<p>
              <h2>  /tmp and /var/tmp  </h2>
<p>
     /tmp is a small directory used by system utilities for short term
scratch files.  Users should not place their  files  in  /tmp.    User
files  should  be  placed  in user directories (every user has one) or
/var/tmp (again, short term storage).
<p>
     Files residing in /tmp and /var/tmp can be deleted without notice
if  disk  space  becomes  critical.    See  "Disk  Quota"  above   for
information about requesting disk quota changes.
<p>
     /tmp and /var/tmp are local to each system in the cluster.

                   <h2>  Software  </h2>
<p>
     The cluster file /usr/local/doc/cluster contains cluster details,
including  a  table  showing software availability.   Please read this
file for full cluster details.
