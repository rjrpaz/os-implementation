<h2>CMSC417 - Computer Networks</h2>
<h2> Late Policy</h2>
<P>
The late policy for CMSC417 (Spring 1997) is that no late programming
assignments will be accepted.  If you are unable to complete a
programming assignment due to illness or family emergency, please
see Dr. Hollingsworth as soon as possible to make special arrangements.
