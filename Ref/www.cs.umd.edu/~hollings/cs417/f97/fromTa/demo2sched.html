You should plan to show up at least 5 minutes before your demonstration
to start setting things up.<p>

If you cannot make these times, the preferred alternate date would be
the afternoon of Sunday, Dec. 14th.

Submission date for the project is around 9:00 Monday Dec. 15th.<p>

Please try and have your ATM and AAL7 layers integrated as much as
possible.  If you abosolutely cannot, you will have to include an extensive
readme which details what tests you've done and so forth.  It would also be
a good idea to submit the source code for your tests.<p>
