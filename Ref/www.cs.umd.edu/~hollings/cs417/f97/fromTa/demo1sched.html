You should plan to show up at least 5 minutes before your demonstration
to start setting things up.

A project team that is doing OK will be able to show 3-4 parts of the system
working at this level.  The timer thread is particularly important to be
able to demonstrate since many other parts rely upon it.  Other parts might
include: converting a link-state table to a routing table,
sending hello messages, AAL7 connection establishment, packet checksums,
ATM signaling, a sliding window, etc.<br>
