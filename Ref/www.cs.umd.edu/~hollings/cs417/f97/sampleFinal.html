<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>CSMA/CD</LI>
<LI>packet</LI>
<LI>leaky bucket</LI>
<LI>CIDR (Classless InterDomain Routing)</LI>
<LI>Hamming distance</LI></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI> (15 points) Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of layering protocols in a computer network.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI> (20 Points)  Explain how Manchester encoding provides a way for the sender and receiver to synchronize their clocks.  Why does this ability to recover the clock have the effect of reducing the bandwidth utilization?</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI> (25 Points) Information security</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Why should a one time pad be used only once?</LI>
<LI>Explain how a one time pad can be used to provide authentication and privacy of a message.</LI>
<LI>If only authentication is required, explain how the addition of MD-5 could be used to reduce the rate of rate of consumption of a one-time pad.</LI></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>(20 points) Frame and cell sizes</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Bob Bright thinks that 5 bytes of header for the payload in a 53 byte ATM cell is wasteful and proposes that ATM cells should be 1029 bytes long with a 5 byte header. Explain why this solution may not be such a good idea.</LI>
<LI>Sally Smart thinks that having a minimum frame size is wasteful for Ethernet.  She proposes that the minimum frame size be reduced to 1 byte.  Explain why this may not be a good idea.</LI></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI> (15 points)  The available bandwidth on transcontinental links is increasing every year, yet the round-trip latency is starting to approach the speed of light limits.  What are the implications of this for applications such as http?</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI> (10 Points) What is the maximum data rate possible over a 3Mhz channel with 10dB noise?</LI></P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI> (25 Points) TCP</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Why is it sometimes necessary to fragment a TCP packet even though it is shorter than the maximum allowed length of (65,495 bytes)?</LI>
<LI>TCP supports having a receiver set it receive window size to zero, why might a receiver do this?</LI>
<LI>TCP supports sending packets with zero length, why is this useful?</LI>
<LI>TCP uses a packet header and AAL-7 (in your project) used a trailer.  Describe the potential performance advantages of using a trailer vs. a header.</LI></OL>
