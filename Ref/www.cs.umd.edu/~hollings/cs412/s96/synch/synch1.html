<H1>Readers/Writers Problem</H1>

<h2>
Problem
</h2>
   You want to have a "critical section" where multiple writers
are allowed, as well as multiple readers, but at no time should
readers and writers be allowed in at the same time.   You want
a deadlock free, starvation free solution.

<h2>
Solution
</h2>
  Below is code for the reader processes.   The writer process
is analogous.   Just replace "r" for "w" and vice-versa.  As
a reminder, <tt>r_active</tt> is the number of active readers
(readers in critical section, <tt>r_waiting</tt> is the
number of readers waiting to go into the critical section.
<tt>r_sem</tt> is the semaphore that waiting readers sleep
on.   The writers have analogous variables. <tt>lock</tt> is 
a mutex semaphore used by both readers and writers.  

<PRE>
 1   P( lock ); // lock is a mutex and is initializes to 1.
 2    if ( nw_active + nw_waiting == 0 )
 3     {
 4        nr_active++; // Notify we are active
 5        V( r_sem );  // Allow ourself to get through
 6     }
 7   else
 8     nr_waiting++;  // We are waiting
 9   V( lock );
10   P( r_sem );  // Readers will wait here, if they must wait.
11
12   READING...
13
14   P( lock );
15   nr_active--;
16   if (( nr_active == 0 ) && ( nw_waiting > 0 )) // If we are the last reader
17     {
18        while ( nw_waiting > 0 )  // Allow all waiting writers to enter
19        {
20           V( w_sem );  // wake a writer;
21           w_active++;  // one more active writer
22           w_waiting--; // one less waiting writer.
23        }
24      }
25   V( lock );
</PRE>

    Here is an intuition of how the algorithm behaves.   You have
a room, maybe it has windows so you can look inside.   Just outside
this room, there are two benches.   One for readers, one for writers.

    Suppose you are a writer, and are coming in.   You look inside
the room.   If there are readers in the room, you sit on the bench.   If
there are writers in the room, but there are readers sitting on
the bench to go in, you will sit on a bench.   Basically, this will
prevent starvation.   You will be polite and allow the reader to have
a chance to go in.    

    If you a writer waiting to enter, and there are writers in the
room as well as readers on the bench, then the last writer to exit
will let all waiting readers into the room.   Then, the last reader
to exit will let all the writers in.

     Some invariants that hold:
<UL>
  <LI>   Safety conditions:  Readers and writers can not be active at
               the same time.
  <UL>
  <LI> <tt>     nr_active > 0 -> nw_active == 0  </tt>
  <LI> <tt>     nw_active > 0 -> nr_active == 0  </tt>
  </UL>

  <LI>    Other conditions.
  <UL>
  <LI> <tt>     nr_active > 0 & nr_waiting > 0 -> nw_waiting > 0 </tt>
  <LI> <tt>     nw_active > 0 & nw_waiting > 0 -> nr_waiting > 0 </tt>
  </UL>

  <LI>   Readers can't be both active and waiting unless a writer
         is waiting.
</UL>
<P>
   So, basically, if a writer is waiting, then either readers are
in the room, and the last reader will let the writer in, or writers
are in the room, in which case we waited because readers were waiting,
and thus the last writer will let in the readers, and the last reader
will let us in.
<P>
    The last writer will check if there are any readers waiting, and
if so, let all readers in.   So, as the writers are in the room, if
there are more readers and writers coming in, then all the readers
that are on the bench as the last writer leaves are the ones sent
in the room.
<P>
    There is the same for the flip case (i.e., substitute readers for
writers and vice versa in the above, and what I said still holds).
<P>
    Note that this really makes no assumptions about processes
being blocked in FIFO order.   In the last while loop, we basically
wake up all waiting writers.   There might be some simplification
(can't think of one though) were process woken in the order they
went to sleep, but I believe this algorithm makes no such assumption,
and in general, it should make no such assumptions.

<H2> More discussion </H2>
    In line 20, we wake up any sleeping writers.   Will we violate
safety conditions (i.e., will readers and writers be in the critical
section).   If we are at line 20, then line we executed line 16, which
means that there are no active readers.   The process that is
executing code in line 20 must have been the last reader, and since
it is already in this part of the code, it has already completed
executing the critical section (reading).  But, perhaps another
reader will somehow sneak into the critical section.  Let's
argue this can't happen.
<P>
   Because the current process is at line 20, then another reader
must be excluded from lines 1-9.  That's because the current process
hold "lock", which is a mutex variable, and thus no other process can
be in between <tt>P(lock)</tt> and <tt>V(lock)</tt>.  So, a reader
that is attempting to sneak in is either just before line 1, or
just after line 19.
<P>
   If a reader (call it "R") is just before line 1, then the current 
process will eventually set <tt>w_active</tt> to be greater than 1, 
and this happens before the reader can get to line 2 (because 
of the mutex lock).  When "R" enters this section, it will test
line 2, then see that there is a waiting process, and eventually
go to sleep at line 10.   So, "R" won't get to read while the
writers are writing.
<P>
   Otherwise, "R" is just after line 9.   If it expects to get
into the critical section, then it must have executed line 5,
which means it must have executed line 4.   It must have done
so before the current process got past line 14 (again, because
of the mutex).   Once the current process reaches line 16, 
<tt>nr_active </tt>will not be zero, and hence, it will not have woken
up the sleeping writers.  So, this is a rough argument for
why a reader can't sneak into the critical section while we
wake the writers.
