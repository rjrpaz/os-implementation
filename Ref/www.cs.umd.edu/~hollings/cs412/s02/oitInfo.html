The OIT Unix cluster systems (details below) share a common  file
system,  common  news  and mail systems, and common users.  This means
users can login to whichever of the systems they want and  their  same
login  id  and  password  will work and their files will be available.
This also means users can do their own "load balancing" by logging  in
to whichever system seems to be best for them at the time.

                      -----  System Details  -----

The cluster machines (known as session servers) are as follows:

           Session Servers
           ---------------
           holmes.umd.edu
           marlowe.umd.edu
           marple.umd.edu
           tracy.umd.edu
           wolfe.umd.edu

To  make  all this easier, users of the OIT Unix cluster can just
login to the generic address dc.umd.edu (dc = detective cluster).

All  mail  sent  to  the   cluster   should   be   addressed   to
<login-id>@umd5.umd.edu  (which  is  the address that is placed on all
outgoing cluster mail).  Mail sent in this manner can be read from any
cluster system.  The machine known as umd5.umd.edu is also part of the
cluster but acts as a server for the cluster.   DO NOT  USE  UMD5  for
anything other than your EMAIL address.  Never login to umd5.

Games, IRC, and MUDs are not allowed on the OIT Unix cluster.

The  home directories contain default .login, .cshrc, and .logout
files.  In addition, the access mode on the home directories has  been
set  to 700.  This means that a student will not be able to copy files
from an unsuspecting student, unless the owner changes the mode of his
home directory to something  that  allows  such  access.    

User  files  are  NFS mounted on various servers.  Symbolic links
are used to create the file names found in the system  password  file.
This  means  the  names  returned by the pwd command may not match the
names found in the system password file.  Users should always refer to
home directories by the ~loginid or $HOME methods.


                          University of Maryland
          Guidelines for the Acceptable Use of Computing Resources

Primary Principles:  Freedom of Expression and Personal Responsibility

Freedom of expression and an open environment to pursue scholarly inquiry
and for sharing of information are encouraged, supported, and protected at
the University of Maryland.  These values lie at the core of our academic
community.  Censorship is not compatible with the tradition and goals of the
University.  While some computing resources may be dedicated to specific
research, teaching, or administrative tasks that would limit their use,
freedom of expression must, in general, be protected.  The University does
not limit access to information due to its content when it meets the
standard of legality.  The University's policy of freedom of expression
applies to computing resources.

Concomitant with free expression are personal obligations of each member of
our community to use computing resources responsibly, ethically, and in a
manner which accords both with the law and the rights of others.  The campus
depends first upon a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation to create and
maintain an open community of responsible users.

General

These guidelines set forth standards for responsible and acceptable use of
University computing resources.  They supplement existing University
policies, agreements, and state and federal laws and regulations.  Computing
resources include host computer systems, University-sponsored computers and
workstations, communications networks, software, and files.

Computing resources are provided to support the academic research,
instructional, and administrative objectives of the University.  These
resources are extended for the sole use of University faculty, staff,
students, and other authorized users ("users") to accomplish tasks related
to the user's status at the University, and consistent with University's
mission.

Users are responsible for safeguarding their identification (ID) codes and
passwords, and for using them for their intended purposes only.  Each user
is responsible for all transactions made under the authorization of his or
her ID, and for all network activity originating from his or her data jack.
Users are solely responsible for their personal use of computing resources
and are prohibited from representing or implying that the content
constitutes the views or policies of the University.

Violation of these guidelines constitutes unacceptable use of computing
resources, and may violate other University policies and/or state and
federal law.  Suspected or known violations should be reported to the
appropriate University computing unit.  Violations will be processed by the
appropriate University authorities and/or law enforcement agencies.
Violations may result in revocation of computing resource privileges,
academic dishonesty or Honor Council proceedings, faculty, staff or student
disciplinary action, or legal action.

User Responsibilities

The following provisions describe conduct prohibited under these guidelines:

1.      Altering system software or hardware configurations without
authorization, or disrupting or interfering with the delivery or
administration of computing resources.

2.      Attempting to access or accessing another's account, private files,
or e-mail without the owner's permission; or misrepresenting oneself as
another individual in electronic communication.

3.      Installing, copying, distributing or using software in violation of:
copyright and/or software agreements; applicable state and federal laws; or
the principles described in Using Software, A Guide to the Ethical and Legal
Use of Software for Members of the Academic Community, available at
www.inform.umd.edu/software-guide.

4.      Using computing resources to engage in conduct which interferes with
others' use of shared computing resources and/or the activities of other
users, including studying, teaching, research, and University
administration.

5.      Using computing resources for commercial or profit-making purposes
without written authorization from the University.

6.      Failing to adhere to individual departmental or unit lab and system
policies, procedures, and protocols.

7.      Allowing access to computing resources by unauthorized users.

8.      Using computing resources for illegal activities.  Criminal and
illegal use may include obscenity, child pornography, threats, harassment,
copyright infringement, defamation, theft, and unauthorized access.

Administration

The maintenance, operation, and security of computing resources require
responsible University personnel to monitor and access the system.  To the
extent possible in the electronic environment and in a public setting, a
user's privacy will be preserved.  Nevertheless, that privacy is subject to
the Maryland Access to Public Records Act, other applicable state and
federal laws, and the needs of the University to meet its administrative,
business, and legal obligations.

                      ----------  Help  ----------

      OIT  provides  First-Aid and general consulting services to those
who use Unix computing systems on campus.  OIT Unix machines  run  the
Digital  Unix  version  of Unix.   With the realization that there are
other versions of Unix being used on campus,  First-Aid  and  the  OIT
Help  Desk  will  address questions based on their experience with the
OIT Unix cluster.

      Students should use the First-Aid service  (located  in  all
WAM  workstation  laboratories).    They  may  also  use the First-Aid
Hotline for phone-in questions ((301) 405-6941), which is answered  by
First-Aiders in the PGII WAM lab.

      Exact hours of service are posted at each First-Aid station.

      OIT  has  replaced the stock lpr program with a shell script that
calls MDQS to print a file on prl, which is  the  3800  laser  printer
attached to the campus IBM system.

      The call is   lpr <file>   to initiate printing of file <file>.

      Output  may be retrieved at the OIT dispatch counter in room 1299
of the A.V. Williams I building.

                 ----------  File Recovery  ----------

      A dump of all files is taken every week.  These file backups  are
for recovery from catastrophic loss.  Individual user file recovery is
not available at this time.

                   ----------  Passwords  ----------

      Unix  systems do not have the concept of an account manager; this
means that if a user forgets their password, OIT must  change  it  for
the user.

      Requests for change of password should be made to Ira Gold at the
address  above.    Requests  to  change student passwords will only be
honored when they are made by the instructor.   Instructors  can  make
such requests via electronic mail.  Requests must include login id and
may include a suggested new password (must be 6 - 8 characters long).

                   ----------  Disk Quota  ----------

      All  user  login  ids  on  the OIT Unix cluster have a disk quota
associated with them.  When the disk quota is exceeded, the user  will
not  be able to create new files until the amount of disk space in use
has been reduced, or the disk quota has been increased.

      Requests for change of disk quota should be made to Ira  Gold  at
the  address above.   Requests to change student disk quotas will only
be honored when they are made by the instructor.  Instructors can make
such requests via electronic mail.   Requests must include  login  id,
desired  new disk quota (expressed in megabytes), and system name.  In
all cases, requests for higher disk quotas will be  evaluated  against
system resources and system load.

               ----------  /tmp and /var/tmp  ----------

      /tmp is a small directory used by system utilities for short term
scratch  files.    Users  should  not place their files in /tmp.  User
files should be placed in user directories (every  user  has  one)  or
/var/tmp (again, short term storage).

      Files residing in /tmp and /var/tmp can be deleted without notice
if   disk  space  becomes  critical.    See  "Disk  Quota"  above  for
information about requesting disk quota changes.

      /tmp and /var/tmp are local to each system in the cluster.

                    ----------  Software  ----------

      The cluster file /usr/local/doc/cluster contains cluster details,
including a table showing software availability.    Please  read  this
file for full cluster details.
