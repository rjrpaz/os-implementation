<h2> Late Policy</h2>

<P>
The late policy for CMSC412 (Spring 2004) is that no late programming
assignments, homework or graded materials will be accepted.  If you are 
unable to complete an assignment due to illness or family emergency, please
see Dr. Hollingsworth  or Dr. Keleher as soon as possible to make special arrangements.
