CMSC412 - Project #5 : submission instructions
</h1>

<li>
<b>
Linuxlab machines (accessible from console or over the network)
are the standard, supported, development environment for the project.
<br>
We will test by running your projects on a linuxlab machine, without necessarily being there (e.g.remote connection with ssh).
<br>That means *bochs runs on a linuxlab machine*.
<p>
So the good news is you don't have to physically be there to test it before submission; you can ssh, export DISPLAY, run bochs etc.
<br>
The bad news is that you must test it on a linuxlab machine.
"It runs on my bochs at home" is not an excuse for a project that doesn't run.
<p>
Once again, before submitting make sure your project
*runs atop of a bochs running on a linuxlab machine*.
It doesn't matter whether you are at UMD in the Linuxlab or at home for that. </b>

<h2>
Submitting your code
</h2>
<P>
The submit program is in ~hollings/bin/submit on the class Linux cluster.
You should do your submit as follows:
<pre>
cd path_to_your_project/proj5
gmake clean

cd buildFat
gmake clean

cd ..
cd userProgs
gmake clean

cd ../..
tar cvf proj5.tar proj5
gzip proj5.tar
~hollings/bin/submit 5 proj5.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>
<p>
It is important to cleanup .o's before submitting and to make sure
you submit a tar file that contains proj5 as the directory it creates.
<br>
You can submit as many times as you want. We will grade your last submission. 
<p>
<b>Checking your submission</b> 
<pre>
ls -l /afs/csic.umd.edu/users/hollings/Class/MP5/cs412XYZ*
</pre>
where XYZ is of course your account number.
