Executing <tt>pcinqtest.c</tt> will run through each of these. The ouput will be lines with the functionality listed in 
the first column, the output (PASSED/FAILED) and the score of the particular test.  

Correct implementation is worth <font color=blue>85</font> points. </p>

<li> <b>File Persistence</b> using <a href="write.c">write.c</a> and <a href="cat.c">cat.c</a> <br>
At the shell prompt, typing:</p>

<pre> /c/write.exe </pre>

should output
<pre>
Formatting...
Mounting...
Mounted file system on drive 1 of type gosfs onto /d
Writing...
Wrote file /d/testWrite
</pre>

Then shutting down bochs, then running it again and typing:</p>

<pre> /c/mount.exe 1 /d gosfs
 /c/cat.exe /d/testWrite </pre>

should output
<pre>
Mounted file system on drive 1 of type gosfs onto /d
Hello.  If you see this your write works.

Correct implementation is worth <font color=blue>15</font> points. </p>

<font color=red><b>Obviously, when grading, we will use the above programs but change names for files/directories (<tt>pcinqtest.c</tt>) and test string (<tt>write.c/cat.c</tt>)</b></font>
<p>
<font color=red><b>If you can not get some tests working you have the option of not testing them.  With your submission 
include a TESTING file that says the last test in <tt>pcinqtest.exe</tt> to run.  We will run it up to that point and 
stop tests.  The second test using <tt>write.exe/cat.exe</tt> will still be performed.</b></font>

<font color=maroon>
<p>Updated (04/21)
<p>We'll test the 5MB read/write by performing a full write and a few random reads. Your write (first half of tFiveMegs()) has to complete in <b>5 minutes</b>. </font>
