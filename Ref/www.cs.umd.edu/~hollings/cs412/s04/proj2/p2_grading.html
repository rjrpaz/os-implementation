<body><center><b>Project 2 Grading Criteria</b></center></p>


<b>Load program, Print_String</b><br>

When your GeekOS boots, it should start shell.exe. If shell.exe loads and
the prompt shows up and nothing crashes, you have passed this test.
This is good for a grade of <font color=blue>70</font>.</p>

<b>Alternate Load program test</b><br>

If you can't get Print_String to work but you can load a program
and call SYS_NULL, that is worth <font color=blue>60</font> points. If this is the
case with your program, alter main.c so that null.exe is loaded
when GeekOS boots and add a print statement to the Null syscall
handler. Printing "Have mercy upon my soul!" might be appropriate.
If this prints at startup and nothing crashes, you will receive
<font color=blue>60</font> points and <font color=red>no other tests will be performed</font>.</p>

<b>Get_Key()</b><br>

If keys can be pressed at the shell.exe prompt and they show up properly,
this will earn you an additional <font color=blue>5</font> points.</p>

<b>Spawn_Program()</b><br>

At the prompt, the grader will type:</p>

<pre>  /c/a.exe</pre></p>

The output should be:</p>

<pre>  The first string Hi ! This is the first string

  The second string Hi ! This is the second string

</pre>This output will earn you an additional <font color=blue>5</font> points.</p>

<b>Exit()</b><br>

After a.exe finishes, control should return to shell.exe. If this
happens without a crash, this will earn you an additional <font color=blue>5</font> points.</p>

<b>Wait()</b><br>

At the prompt, the grader will type:</p>

<pre>  /c/long.exe</pre></p>

The output should be:</p>

<pre>  Start Long
  End Long
  %

</pre>The prompt should not appear until long.exe has exited. If your
output is something like:</p>

<pre>  Start Long
  %End Long

</pre>This indicates a problem in your Wait() syscall.</p>

Passing this test will earn you and additional <font color=blue>5</font> points.</p>

<b>Security</b><br>

There will be two security tests that will test if you are
properly checking data passed through syscalls. These programs
will not be made available to you until after grading is
finished. These tests are worth <font color=blue>5</font> points each.</p>

Note: In order to receive credit for the security tests, you
must have implemented the Sys_Print and Sys_Spawn
syscalls as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>upon calling:
  <ul>
  <li>ebx contains a pointer to the string</li>
  <li>ecx contains the length of the string</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>upon return:
  <ul>
  <li>for Sys_Print: eax contains 0 if the call succeeded, -1 if the call failed</li>
  <li>for Sys_Spawn: eax contains the new PID if the call succeeded, -1 if the call failed</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
If any part of a string that lies outside of user space, the
string should not be printed and the call should fail.</p>
