<center><b>Security Tests for Project 2</center></b><br>
In the end, we only used one security test for the projects - it's a test<br>
of whether your project will print a pointer from outside of user space:<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="sec1.c">sec1.c</a><br><br>
We didn't do a test of whether your project will print 
a string that starts in<br>
user space but extends outside of user space since there are some ways<br>
that the test might give false results.
