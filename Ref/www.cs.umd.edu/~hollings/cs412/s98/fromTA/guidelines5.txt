Project 5 Grading Guidelines
----------------------------

Shell costs 50%, kernel 50%. The grade starts at 100 (kernel+shell) or 50
(shell only) and is reduced by the cost of each encountered error.

Combined
--------

- Extra verbiage: -0

Shell
-----

Similar errors combined up to 25. Grade keeps non-negative.

- does not edit command line with backspace: -7
- ESC echoed at the end of input (as the character #26, usually a small left
  arrow): -1.

- Sometimes modules do not exit to shell: -5

- cat|tee|goofy|wc -l crashes or freezes: -7
- cat|tee|goofy|wc crashes or freezes as well: another -4
- cat|tee|goofy|wc replicates output (stderr or stdout) more than it should: -2

- one|two would not allow two to accept arguments (and farther in the pipe):
  -7
- no parameters accepted: -10
- arguments off by one (eg argv[1] becomes argv[2]): -5

- crashes or freezes after several commands have been processed: -6

- cannot tee or goofy: -10
- cannot |tee or |goofy (inside a pipe): -7

- goofy does not return to OS: -5
- another command does not return to OS: -8
- goofy inserts whitespace between consecutive characters: -2

- stderr hooked to stdin (symptoms: wrong count on tee|wc; stderr goofied): -15

- does not do multiple pipes: -15
- does not do pipes: -25

- cat|tee does not retain end-of-line: -4

- 2nd shell (run as a user process on top of another copy) does not perform
  anything: -5
- Exit from 2nd shell "falls through" and exits OS: -0

Kernel
------

- test1 crashes or freezes: -25
- test1 crashes or freezes at the end: -15
- test1 performs a wrong order: -8

NOTE: The other 25% for the kernel account for the shell support.

Bonus
-----

Shell bonus added to the shell graded calculated by the above rules, up to 50.

- Input echoed: +5
- Prompt safe (from being overwritten by backspace): +7
- MOD extension not required: +5
- Pipe sign "|" serves as a delimiter, thus allowing "one|two" etc instead of
  "one | two": +7. Only "one |two" allowed: +2.
- A shortcut "hot button" exit from OS: +3.
- Can dynamically change prompt (as a command line operation): +2.

NOTE: Because of the bonuses, projects with small errors can get the full
grade.
