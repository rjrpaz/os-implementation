<B><font size="+3"><center>Project 3:</center></font></B>
<B><font size="+2"><center>Additional Requirements</center></font></B> <P>

<B><font size="+1">Interface Header File</font></B> <li> Please put
all global names <I>visible to the user</I> in a header file <font
color="red"><CODE>user412.h</CODE></font> which will be included by
the user code (<CODE>proc.c</CODE> and alike) together with
<CODE>cmsc412.h</CODE> as well as Borland (standard) header files, as
needed. (This means that you do not have to duplicate names declared
in <CODE>cmsc412.h</CODE> file.) The global names include (1) function
prototypes; (2) global variables, if any; (3) also macro definitions.
Make sure that file <CODE>user412.h</CODE> lists <I>all</I> names that
can be used in the user code, to let it work with the keyboard,
screen, timer, etc. Also, make sure no names are listed that the user
is not supposed to use. This time, I <B>will</B> read your source
code. <P>

<B><font size="+1">Scheduling Experiments</font></B> <li> Please run
experiments with both scheduling algorithms you are supposed to
implement and write a short (one-paragraph) description of your
observations. This could include processes' order of execution,
latency, effective throughput, average latency, etc., for different
quantum sizes, perhaps different types of batches. You do not have to
make an essay of this, please. However, your observations will be
compared with ours. <P>

<B><font size="+1">Compiler Warnings</font></B> <li> Starting with the
<I>next</I> project, we will require that your code compiles without
warnings (without errors too). In this project, we ask you to try and
get rid of the warnings too, so you will be comfortable the next time.
<P>

In general, you will need to polish your code so that it would not
look "suspicous" for the compiler. However, sometimes we need to write
code that would cause wanrings to be generated (as is the case with
the <CODE>System_service()</CODE> function, for instance). To force
particular conditions that generate warnings to be checked, or not
checked, you can use either <CODE>-w</CODE> option of the Borland
compiler or <CODE>#pragma&nbsp;warn</CODE> for a more selective
choice. Please read the appropriate Borland help files to familiarize
yourself with these features. <P>

By default, the compiler disables some warnings and enables the
others. We do not want you to <I>disable</I> warnings using the
compiler option <CODE>-w</CODE> and you can only use the
<CODE>#pragma&nbsp;warn</CODE> for this purpose. If you want to
<I>enable</I> warnings that are disabled by default, feel free to use
either method. <P>
