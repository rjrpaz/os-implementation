		Approximate Guidelines
(I gave myself a leeway of a few points to steer around strange cases)


			* * *


Tests 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 take 20 points each, making up the maximum score of 100.
Following is the list of possible mistakes/errors and how much they cost; also
listed are bonuses that work whenever fines have been applied. The maximal
fine per test is 20 (does not go negative).



General Issues
--------------

Experiments: if there is no writeup, the fine is -10 points. If the
description is more meaningful than empty handwaving and shamanism, the bonus
is +5 points. If it is not, there is usually no bonus.

No readme file: ok.

File user412.h is missing: fine -10 points.
File user412.h is useless: fine -7 points.
File user412.h is misnamed: fine -3 points.
Important global names missing in user412.h:
	one name: fine -0 points;
	more names: fine -1 point.

Makefile misnamed: fine -0 points.
Makefile contains proc2.c instead of proc.c: fine -0 points.

Default quantum is not 4: fine -0 points.

Specific Issues
---------------

Test 4 is a bonus test: if all 4 passes are okay, the bonus is +7 points. If
all is okay but the program freezes at the end, the bonus is still up to +3.

If a test crashes or freezes in the middle of execution, the fine is -20
points (loses all). If a test freezes at the end, the fine is -7 per test (or
-5 per test case), but no more than -20 total.

If a test is only working with Wait() functions disabled, the fine is -15
points per test, but no more than 30 points total.

If a test falls through Wait calls (does not wait), the fine is -10 points.

If extra output slips on the screen after Wait() is called, the fine is -2
points per instance.

If the output is inconsistent (sometime a test works, sometimes it does not),
the starting grade is 10 points.

Test 0:
. Tested with the following arguments:
  no arguments; -q 1; -q 1 -m; -q 9999; -q 9999 -m.
. Exits prematurely (as if there were no processes): -20 points (loses all).
. Processes do not take turns: -10.
. Processes take "long" turns (do not preempt each other as often as they
	should): -5.
. Wrong order of processes execution: -3 per test case.

Test 1:
. Tested without parameters.
. Processes do not take turns: fine -10 points.
. Wrong order of execution of processes: fine -8 points.
. Processes take long turns: -5 points.

Test 2:
. Tested with the following parameters:
  no parameters (should be equivalent to -q 4 -f); -q 1; -q 20; -q 22; -q 256;
  -q 20 -m.
. Substantially wrong time: fine -7 points.

Test 3:
. Tested without parameters.
. Wrong order of execution: fine -15 points.
. Wrong order AND freeze at the end: -20 points.

Test 4:
. Tested without parameters.
. Bonus test: see above.

Test 5:
. Tested without parameters.
. Error(s) on (a) smoker(s): -7 points.
