Subject: Project 2 wrap-up

Good morning (or another time of day)!

This Wednesday, 1pm, is the deadline for project 2.

Most of the students who took the class in the past agree that this
phase is remembered as the hardest one. This is why you had 3
weeks to complete it. Other phases may have less time.

The code from phase 2 will be used extensively in further phases.
You want to have it thoroughly tested. Was debugging difficult? It
will be even more difficult in the next phase, with timer
interrupts making the execution history non-repeatable. You want
to be sure you can rely on the part of the kernel you have written
already.

In fact, the next phase will not be officially given to you until
after the mid-term. Spend that time preparing for the exam, it is
important (for both the material and the grade).

A few words about tests. I will have a collection of tests of
various difficulty. Each test will be copied to a proc.c file, the
project recompiled and run. The simplest test will just call the
Init() function, but you want to test more than that. See if a
recursion works properly. As specified, I will not run more than
10 processes *concurrently*. 

As usual, I hold my office hours on Tuesday, 2:00-3:30 pm. If this
time is not convenient, you may try to catch me on campus or set
up an appointment; however, do not do that on Wednesday morning,
okay? :-)

Good luck!

Simon
