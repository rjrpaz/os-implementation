<H1>Cigarette Smoker's Problem</H1>

<h2>
Problem
</h2>
   There are four processes in this problem: three smoker processes
and an agent process.   Each of the smoker processes will make
a cigarette and smoke it.   To make a cigarette requires 
tobacco, paper, and matches.   Each smoker process has one of
the three items.  I.e., one process has tobacco, another has
paper, and a third has matches.   The agent has an infinite 
supply of all three.   The agent places two of the three items
on the table, and the smoker that has the third item makes the
cigarette.   Synchronize the processes.

<h2>
Solution
</h2>
   This seems like a fairly easy solution.   The three smoker
processes will make a cigarette and smoke it.   If they can't
make a cigarette, then they will go to sleep.   The agent process
will place two items on the table, and wake up the appropriate
smoker, and then go to sleep.   All semaphores except <tt>lock</tt> are
initialized to 0.  <tt>lock</tt> is initialized to 1, and is a mutex
variable.
<P>
   Here's the code for the agent process.
<PRE>
 1   do forever {
 2     P( lock );
 3     randNum = rand( 1, 3 ); // Pick a random number from 1-3
 4     if ( randNum == 1 ) {
 5        // Put tobacco on table
 6        // Put paper on table
 7        V( smoker_match );  // Wake up smoker with match
 8      } else if ( randNum == 2 ) {
 9        // Put tobacco on table
10        // Put match on table
11        V( smoker_paper );  // Wake up smoker with paper
12      } else {
13        // Put match on table
14        // Put paper on table
15        V( smoker_tobacco ); } // Wake up smoker with tobacco
16      V( lock );
17      P( agent );  //  Agent sleeps
18     }  // end forever loop
</PRE>
<p>
   I will give code to one of the smokers.   The others are
analogous.
<PRE>
 1   do forever {
 2      P( smoker_tobacco );  // Sleep right away
 3      P( lock );
 4      // Pick up match
 5      // Pick up paper
 6      V( agent );
 7      V( lock );
 8      // Smoke (but don't inhale).
 9   }
</PRE>
<p>
    The smoker immediately sleeps.   When the agent puts the two
items on the table, then the agent will wake up the appropriate
smoker.   The smoker will then grab the items, and wake the agent.
While the smoker is smoking, the agent can place two items on
the table, and wake a different smoker (if the items placed
aren't the same).   The agent sleeps immediately after placing
the items out.   This is something like the producer-consumer
problem except the producer can only produce 1 item (although
a choice of 3 kinds of items) at a time.
