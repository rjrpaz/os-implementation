Here are a few suggested problems to help you prepare for the
midterm.
<OL>
<LI>Chapter 1:  1.7
<LI>Chapter 2:  2.3<B>, </B>2.4, 2.11
<LI>Chapter 3: 3.5, 3.9, 3.11, 3.12
<LI>Chapter 4: 4.7, 4.6
<LI>What is a process and why might I want one?
<LI>Chapter 6: 6.7, 6.8, 6.17, (solution to <a href="barber">barber problem</a>)
<LI>Chapter 7: 7.1, 7.5, 7.15
<LI>Assume that we are going to design a processor that makes
a very  large number of  registers of various types available
to an operating system. Assume that the goal is to support extremely
fast  (just a few cycles at most) thread switching. 
<OL>
<LI>What kinds of registers would you want to replicate, and how
would you  design your operating system to enhance the prospect
of being able to carry out  fast thread switching? 
<LI>Will it always be possible to ensure that a thread switch
will take place within just a few cycles?  If not, give some examples
of where difficulties might arise.
</OL>

<LI>In your project 2,  in the interrupt handler for system_service,
the case statement for yield did a gen_interrupt call.  Why was
it done that way?  Explain how to remove this &quot;extra&quot;
interrupt.
<LI>When setting up your stack segment, you pushed the address
of proc_term on the stack.  Why did you do this?  Will this item
always be used?  When will it be used?
<LI>How many bits are there in address returned by safe_malloc?
</OL>
