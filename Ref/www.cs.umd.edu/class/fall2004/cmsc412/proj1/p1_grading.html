<p>Needless to say 
<li>we'll be testing with a version of a.c that
prints different strings and just printing out the above strings with Print
statements will get you nothing but a one-way ticket to Palookaville.
<li>it is forbidden to hardcode values for offsets or sizes (values found in the ELF header). If you do, you will lose points.   
<li>after testing the functionality we will do a <i>diff</i>
between the code you submitted and the codebase we provided, so that we see exactly which code you added or modified.
