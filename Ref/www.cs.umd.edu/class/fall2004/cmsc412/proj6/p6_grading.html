Executing <tt>p6test.exe</tt> will run through each of these. The ouput will be lines with the functionality listed in
the first column, the output (PASSED/FAILED) and the score of the particular test.

Correct implementation is worth <font color=blue>60</font> points. </p>

<li> <b>Synchronization</b> using <tt>/c/ppstart.exe</tt>, <tt>/c/ping6.exe</tt>, <tt>/c/pong6.exe</tt><br>
This is a straightforward bidirectional send/receive test. A process can't go to the next send/receive round until it has
both sent and received a message.
<br>
<p>At the shell prompt, typing:</p>

<pre> /c/ppstart.exe </pre>

should output
<pre>
Starting ping-pong tests...

Starting process X (PING)...
Starting process Y (PONG)...

Process X sent PING, awaiting PONG, got 'PONG'
Process Y sent PONG, awaiting PING, got 'PING'
Process X sent PING, awaiting PONG, got 'PONG'
Process Y sent PONG, awaiting PING, got 'PING'
Process X sent PING, awaiting PONG, got 'PONG'
Process Y sent PONG, awaiting PING, got 'PING'
Process X sent PING, awaiting PONG, got 'PONG'
Process Y sent PONG, awaiting PING, got 'PING'
Process X sent PING, awaiting PONG, got 'PONG'
Process Y sent PONG, awaiting PING, got 'PING'

Process X (PING) is done !

Process Y (PONG) is done !

Ping-pong tests completed.
</pre>
<p>
The 'Starting...' and 'Process ...done' may come in a different order, 
but no deadlock should occur. Obviously, <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> are to be replaced by some pid's.
</p>
<p>A correct run is worth  <font color=blue>20</font> points.</p>

<li> <b>Fragmentation</b> using <tt>/c/fstart.exe</tt>, <tt>/c/fsend.exe</tt>, <tt>/c/frecv.exe</tt><br>
This is a slightly harder test; the sender will have to block 
because its buffer is larger than the mailbox size. 
<br>
<p>At the shell prompt, typing:</p>

<pre> /c/fstart.exe </pre>

should output
<pre>
Starting fragmentation send/receive tests...


Starting process X (Sender)...
Starting process Y (Receiver)...

Process Y (Receiver) received 5 bytes
Process Y (Receiver) received 5 bytes
Process X (Sender) sent 10 bytes

Process Y (Receiver) received 5 bytes
Process Y (Receiver) received 5 bytes
Process X (Sender) sent 10 bytes

Process Y (Receiver) received 5 bytes
Process Y (Receiver) received 5 bytes
Process X (Sender) sent 10 bytes

Process Y (Receiver) received 5 bytes
Process Y (Receiver) received 5 bytes
Process X (Sender) sent 10 bytes

Process Y (Receiver) received 5 bytes
Process Y (Receiver) received 5 bytes
Process X (Sender) sent 10 bytes

Process X (Sender) is done !

Process Y (Receiver) is done !

Fragmentation tests completed.
</pre>
<p>
The 'Starting...' / 'Process ...done' and 'sent' / 'received' (for one round) may come in a different order, 
but no deadlock should occur. Obviously, <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> are to be replaced by some pid's.
</p>
<p>A correct run is worth  <font color=blue>20</font> points.</p>
