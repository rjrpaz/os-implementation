<h1>CMSC412 - Project #0 : submission instructions
</h1>
</center>
<b>Linuxlab machines (accessible from console or over the network)
are the standard, supported, development environment for the
project.&nbsp;
We will test by running your projects on a linuxlab machine, without
necessarily being there (e.g.remote connection with ssh). <br>
</b>
<p><b>So the good news is you don't have to physically be there to
test it before submission; you can ssh, export DISPLAY, run bochs
etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The bad news is that you must test it on a linuxlab machine.
"It runs on my bochs at home" is not an excuse for a project that
doesn't run. </b></p>
<p><b>Once again, before submitting make sure your project
*runs atop of a bochs running on a linuxlab machine*.
It doesn't matter whether you are at UMD in the Linuxlab or at home to
test that fact. </b> </p>

<h2>Submitting your code </h2>
<p>The submit program is in /afs/csic/bin/submit on the class Linux
cluster.
You should do your submit as follows: </p>
<pre>cd ~/project0-cyclone/build<br>gmake clean<br>cd ../..<br>tar cvf proj0.tar project0-cyclone<br>gzip proj0.tar<br>/afs/csic/submit/bin/submit 0 proj0.tar.gz<br></pre>
<font color="red">Checking your submission</font> <br>
<br>
Use the command:
<pre>ls -l /afs/csic/submit/cmsc412/MP0/cs412XYZ*<br></pre>
where XYZ is of course your account number.&nbsp; You should see one
file that has the same size as your submitted file.&nbsp; Later
submissions will overwrite earlier ones.
<p>It is important to cleanup .o's before submitting (by doing gmake
clean as shown above) and to make sure
you submit a tar file that contains project0-cyclone as the directory
it creates.&nbsp; When you unpack this tar file, you should be able to
cd to project-cyclone/build, and then type gmake to make the entire
project build with no problems. </p>
