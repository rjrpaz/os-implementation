<body><center><b>Project 4 Grading Criteria</b></center></p>

<h3>Intermediate submission (Tuesday, March 29th, worth 10 points)</h3>
This will test kernel mapping. 
You should have paging turned on, as described in item 1 below. 
We'll test by looking at the output. If your kernel crashes or paging 
doesn't turn on, we'll check your code and will determine whether 
you've made a 'good faith' attempt at kernel mapping or not.
Note that doing random changes to pretend you've started the kernel mapping
will not bring you the 10%. 

<h3>Project 4 (Friday, April 8th, worth 90 points)</h3>

<ol>
<li> <b> Turning On Paging</b>:<br>
  - Modify the  <tt>Enable_Paging()</tt> call (in Init_VM(), <tt>paging.c</tt>); to  be <tt>checkPaging(); Enable_Paging(); checkPaging()</tt>;</p>

Launching bochs should output:</p>

<pre>
Paging on?: 0
Paging on?: 1
</pre>
when bochs starts up.  Nothing should crash and the shell prompt should come up.  Enabling paging is worth <font color=blue>27</font> points.</p>

<li> <b>Dynamically Growing Stack</b> using <tt>rec.c</tt>.<br>
At the shell prompt, typing:</p>

<pre> /c/rec.exe 300</pre>

should output
<pre>
300
349
348
...
1
%
</pre>

Correct implementation is worth <font color=blue>27</font> points. </p>

<li> <b>Paging Out to a Swapfile</b> using <tt>rec.c</tt>.<br>
At the shell prompt, typing:</p>

<pre> /c/rec.exe 3300</pre>

should output
<pre>
3300
3299
3298
...
1
%
</pre>

Correct implementation is worth <font color=blue>36</font> points.</p>

<li> <b>Extra Credit</b><br>
You can receive <font color=red>10 points</font> of extra credit if you make page tables pageable too,
as described in the project description in the <a href="index.html#ExtraCredit">Extra Credit section</a>.
</ol>
