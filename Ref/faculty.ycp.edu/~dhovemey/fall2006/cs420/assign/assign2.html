<h1>CS 420 - Assignment 2<br>
</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Due Friday, September 15th by 11:59
PM</span><br>
</p>
<p>In this assignment, you will write a file copy program using only
OS-level API functions.<br>
</p>
<h2>Your Task<br>
</h2>
<p>Your program should take two command line arguments.<br>
</p>
<p>The first is the name of an input file, and the second is the name
of the output file.&nbsp; The program should open both files (the input
file for reading and the output file for writing) and copy the entire
contents of the input file into the output file.<br>
</p>
<p>If the entire copy operating is successful, the program should exit
with an exit code of 0.<br>
</p>
<p>If an error occurs, the program should print an error message to the
standard error file descriptor and exit with a non-zero exit code.<br>
</p>
<h2>Restrictions<br>
</h2>
<p>Your program must use only OS-level API functions.&nbsp;
Specifically, you may use any POSIX functions under Linux (or other
Unix variant) or Win32 functions under Windows.&nbsp; [If you would
like to use a different OS-level API, let me know.]<br>
</p>
<p>For POSIX, you will be using functions such as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">open</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">close</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">read</span>, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">write</span>.<br>
</p>
<p>For Win32, you will use functions such as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">CreateFile</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ReadFile</span>, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">WriteFile</span>.<br>
</p>
<p>You must not use any I/O functions from the standard C or C++
libraries.&nbsp; These include functions like <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">printf</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fprintf</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fopen</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fread</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fwrite</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fclose</span>, etc., and also the iostream
facility in C++ (<span style="font-weight: bold;">cin</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cout</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cerr</span>, etc.)<br>
</p>
<p>You may use C, C++, or assembly language to implement your program.<br>
</p>

</p>
<h2>Extra Credit<br>
</h2>
<p>You can earn 20% extra credit by writing your program so that it
issues system calls directly instead of using API functions.&nbsp; This
will require some assembly language programming.&nbsp; (I can give you
more information if you are interested in trying this.)<br>
</p>
<h2>Report<br>
</h2>
<p>Please include a document explaining how you implemented your
program, what sources of information you used, and what API functions
you used.<br>
</p>
<h2>Submission<br>
</h2>
<p>Submit your completed program by copying all needed files into a zip
file and submitting it via the My YCP Inbox under "Assignment 2".&nbsp;
Don't forget to include your report.<br>
</p>
<p>If you are using Visual Studio, include the entire solution
directory in the zip file.<br>
</p>
<p>If you are using gcc under cygwin or Linux, submit a Makefile or
instructions how to compile your program.<br>
