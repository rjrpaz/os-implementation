<h1>CS 420 - Assignment 3</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Due: Thursday, Sept. 21st by 11:59
PM</span><br>
</p>
<p>In class we have discussed how running programs (and the kernel) use
a stack of activation records to store the parameters, local variables,
temporary data, and return addresses associated with procedure calls.<br>
</p>
<p>Each time you invoke a procedure (i.e., call a function or method),
a new activation record is created for that call.&nbsp; A special
processor register, the <span style="font-style: italic;">stack pointer</span>,
keeps track of which activation record is being used, and also points
to a specific data item within the activation record.&nbsp; On x86
CPUs, this is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">esp</span>
register.&nbsp; Sometimes, programs may use an additional register, the
<span style="font-style: italic;">frame pointer</span>, to point to the
current activation record.&nbsp; On x86 CPUs, this is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ebp</span> register.&nbsp; However, the
frame pointer is not strictly necessary, and many compilers simply use
it as an extra general-purpose register.<br>
</p>
<p>Usually, the activation record stack grows down in memory, from
higher addresses to lower addresses.<br>
</p>
<h2>Your Task<br>
</h2>
<p>Your task is to write a program that when executed will determine
whether the stack of procedure activation records grows down or up in
memory.<br>
</p>
<p>Here is the output of my solution (a C++ program) when run on
Windows:<br>
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">Stack grows down<br></pre>
<h2>Hints<br>
</h2>
<p>This is an easy program to write in C and C++.&nbsp; It is
impossible to write in Java (and probably hard or impossible in C#).<br>
</p>
<p>There is a way to write this program that does not involve any
assembly language.&nbsp; (If you want to use some assembly language in
your program---for example, to inspect the contents of processor
registers---that is fine.&nbsp; However, the program itself should be
written in a high level language like C or C++.)<br>
</p>
<h2>Submitting Your Work<br>
</h2>
<p>Package the source code for your program in a zip file along with a
short text document containing a report.<br>
</p>
<p>The report should explain the technique you used to solve the
problem and the output of running it on at least one operating system
(state which OS you used.)<br>
</p>
<p>Submit the zip file via the My YCP Inbox under "Assignment 3".<br>
