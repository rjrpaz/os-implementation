<h2>A better reader/writer lock implementation<br>
</h2>
<p>Implementation:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">struct RW_Lock {<br>    struct Mutex_Lock mutex;<br>    struct Condition noWriters;<br>    struct Condition noActiveWriter;<br>    struct Condition noReaders;<br>    int readers;<br>    int writers;<br>    bool writerActive;<br>};<br><br>void RW_Init(struct RW_Lock *rwLock)<br>{<br>    Mutex_Init(&amp;rwLock-&gt;mutex);<br>    Cond_Init(&amp;rwLock-&gt;noWriters);<br>    Cond_Init(&amp;rwLock-&gt;noWriterActive);<br>    Cond_Init(&amp;rwLock-&gt;noReaders);<br>    rwLock-&gt;readers = 0;<br>    rwLock-&gt;writers = 0;<br>    rwLock-&gt;writerActive = false;<br>}<br><br>void RW_Lock_Read(struct RW_Lock *rwLock)<br>{<br>    Mutex_Lock(&amp;rwLock-&gt;mutex);<br><br>    // Wait until there are no writers<br>    while (rwLock-&gt;writers &gt; 0) {<br>        Cond_Wait(&amp;rwLock-&gt;mutex, &amp;rwLock-&gt;noWriters);<br>    }<br><br>    // Since there are no writers, we can proceed to read<br>    rwLock-&gt;readers++;<br><br>    Mutex_Unlock(&amp;rwLock-&gt;mutex);<br>}<br><br>void RW_Unlock_Read(struct RW_Lock *rwLock)<br>{<br>    Mutex_Lock(&amp;rwLock-&gt;mutex);<br><br>    rwLock-&gt;readers--;<br><br>    // The last reader will signal that there are no readers,<br>    // allowing any waiting writers to proceed<br>    if (rwLock-&gt;readers == 0) {<br>        Cond_Signal(&amp;rwLock-&gt;noReaders);<br>    }<br><br>    Mutex_Unlock(&amp;rwLock-&gt;mutex);<br>}<br><br>void RW_Lock_Write(struct RW_Lock *rwLock)<br>{<br>    Mutex_Lock(&amp;rwLock-&gt;mutex);<br><br>    // Announce intent to write: keep out any new readers<br>    rwLock-&gt;writers++;<br><br>    // Wait for readers to finish<br>    while (rwLock-&gt;readers &gt; 0) {<br>        Cond_Wait(&amp;rwLock-&gt;mutex, &amp;rwLock-&gt;noReaders);<br>    }<br><br>    // Wait for any active writer to finish<br>    while (rwLock-&gt;writerActive) {<br>        Cond_Wait(&amp;rwLock-&gt;mutex, &amp;rwLock-&gt;noWriterActive);<br>    }<br><br>    // Now this thread is the active writer<br>    rwLock-&gt;writerActive = true;<br><br>    Mutex_Unlock(&amp;rwLock-&gt;mutex);<br>}<br><br>void RW_Unlock_Write(struct RW_Lock *rwLock)<br>{<br>    Mutex_Lock(&amp;rwLock-&gt;mutex);<br><br>    rwLock-&gt;writerActive = false;<br>    rwLock-&gt;writers--;<br><br>    // If there are other writers waiting, let the next one take a turn.<br>    // Otherwise, signal that there are no more writers, allowing any waiting readers<br>    // to proceed.<br>    if (rwLock-&gt;writers &gt; 0) {<br>        Cond_Signal(&amp;rwLock-&gt;noWriterActive);<br>    } else /* rwLock-&gt;writers == 0 */ {<br>        Cond_Signal(&amp;rwLock-&gt;noWriters);<br>    }<br><br>    Mutex_Unlock(&amp;rwLock-&gt;mutex);<br>}<br></pre>
<p>This implementation gives preference to writers because <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">RW_Lock_Write</span>() increments the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">writers</span> count early: this serves as
a signal to any new readers that they will need to wait for waiting
writers to complete before they can gain read access to the lock.<br>
</p>
<h2>Deadlocks<br>
</h2>
<p>Deadlocks can occur when mutliple threads acquire two or more locks.<br>
</p>
<p>Example:<br>
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">Thread 1                 Thread 2<br>-----------------------------------------------<br>mutex_lock(&amp;lockA);      mutex_lock(&amp;lockB);<br>mutex_lock(&amp;lockB);      mutex_lock(&amp;lockA);<br></pre>
<p>Now envision the following interleaving:<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thread 1 acquires lockA<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thread 2 acquires lockB<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thread 1 attempts to acquire lockB: it
must wait because thread 2 has already locked it<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thread 2 attempts to acquire lockA: it
must wait because thread 1 has already acquired it<br>
</p>
<p>This is really bad: neither thread will ever be able to run again,
and neither will any other thread attempting to acquire lockA or lockB.<br>
</p>
<h3>Necessary Conditions for Deadlock<br>
</h3>
<p>1. Mutual exclusion.<br>
</p>
<p>2. Hold and wait.&nbsp; [At least one process must be both holding
resource a waiting for another resource.]<br>
</p>
<p>3. No preemption.&nbsp; A thread cannot be forced to give up a
resource it is holding.<br>
</p>
<p>4. Circular wait<br>
</p>
<h3>The Resource Allocation Graph<br>
</h3>
<p>The resource allocation graph is an abstraction for describing
threads, resources, and deadlocks.<br>
</p>
<p>There are two distinct types of vertices<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Process (thread) vertices<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Resource vertices<br>
</p>
<p>An edge from a process vertex P to a resource vertex R means that P
is waiting to acquire R.&nbsp; This is a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">request edge</span>.<br>
</p>
<p>An edge from a resource vertex R to a process vertex P means that P
has acquired R.&nbsp; This is an <span style="font-style: italic;">assignment</span>
edge.<br>
</p>
<p>Note that each resource may have multiple <span
 style="font-style: italic;">instances</span>, meaning that more than
one unit of the resource may be in use at once.&nbsp; (Like a
semaphore: if the initial count is &gt; 1 then multiple threads may use
the semaphore at one time.)<br>
</p>
<p>Resource graph of our example [Silberschatz, pg. 251]:<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt=""
 src="figures/deadlockGraph.png" style="width: 50%;"><br>
</p>
<p>Note that in this example, each resource (lockA and lockB) have only
one instance available.<br>
</p>
<p>Properties:<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the system is in a deadlock, there
will be a cycle in the resource allocation graph<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If each resource has a single instance
(e.g., mutex locks), a cycle implies that there is a deadlock.&nbsp;
Any processes waiting for resources involved in the cycle are
deadlocked.<br>
</p>
<p>Note that if the cycle involves resources of which there are
multiple instances, then a cycle does not necessarily mean there is a
deadlock.&nbsp; Example [Silberschatz]:<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt=""
 src="figures/cycleWithoutDeadlock.png" style="width: 50%;"><br>
</p>
<h3>Self-deadlock</h3>
<p>Note that a single thread can create a deadlock if it tries to
acquire a single-instance resource it has already acquired:<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" src="figures/selfDeadlock.png"
 style="width: 10%;"><br>
</p>
<p>For example, executing the following code<br>
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">mutex lock;<br><br>void f() [<br>    mutex_lock(&amp;lock);<br>    ...<br>    g();<br>    ...<br>    mutex_unlock(&amp;lock);<br>}<br><br>void g() {<br>    mutex_lock(&amp;lock);<br>    ...<br>    mutex_unlock(&amp;lock);<br>}<br></pre>
<p>If the function f() is called, instant deadlock.<br>
</p>
<h3>What kinds of software deadlocks can affect</h3>
<p>Deadlocks can affect any kind of software where multiple threads use
using locks to synchronize access to shared resources.<br>
</p>
<p>Operating system kernels: this is a big problem.&nbsp; A deadlock
can cause the entire system to freeze.<br>
</p>
<p>Multithreaded servers: the server can become unresponsive.&nbsp; The
deadlocked server can be killed and restarted, but this is not ideal.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is not uncommon to use some kind of
watchdog program to monitor a server to periodically check to ensure
that it is still responsive.<br>
</p>
<h2>Handling Deadlocks</h2>
<p>Various strategies exist for handling deadlocks:<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">1. Use a protocol to ensure that a
deadlock can never occur.&nbsp; [Deadlock avoidance, deadlock
detection.]<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">2. Detect deadlocks at runtime, and
recover<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">3. Ignore the problem, hope that
deadlocks never occur<br>
</p>
<p>Option 1 (deadlock avoidance or detection) is probably the best-bet
for critical system software, such as an OS kernel.<br>
</p>
<p>Options 2 is common in database servers.<br>
</p>
<h3>Deadlock Prevention<br>
</h3>
<p>To prevent deadlock, we must make sure that at least one of the four
necessary conditions for deadlock does not occur.<br>
</p>
<p>1. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mutual exclusion</span>.&nbsp;
Doesn't help us too much, since some resources can only be accessed
safely by a single thread.<br>
</p>
<p>2. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hold and wait</span>.&nbsp; We
can address this prerequsiite for deadlock by ensuring that no process
holds more than one resource at a time.&nbsp; One way to accomplish
this is to protect all shared resources with a single lock (in essence,
creating a single shared resource).&nbsp; Easy, commonly used by early
versions of Unix and Linux (and still used by Windows).&nbsp; Not good
for scalability of multiprocessors.<br>
</p>
<p>3. <span style="font-weight: bold;">No preemption</span>.&nbsp;
Example: when a thread waits, it must release any locks it is currently
holding.&nbsp; The problem with this approach is locks are often used
to protect access to shared data structures; while holding the lock,
the data structure is very likely in an inconsistent state.&nbsp;
Releasing a lock guarding a data structure in an inconsistent state is
a really bad idea.&nbsp; (E.g., a linked list that has broken or
circular links.)<br>
</p>
<p>4. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Circular wait</span>.&nbsp;
This is the most commonly-used way of preventing deadlocks: ensure that
there can never be a cycle in the resource graph.&nbsp; This is done by
enforcing a global lock acquisition order which takes the form of
statements like "lockB can only be acquired after lockA, never
before".&nbsp; All threads must be written in a way that honors this
ordering.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The question is, how can this ordering be
enforced?&nbsp; What if programmers unintentionally violate it?&nbsp;
Two basic techniques:<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">1. Report any violations
dynamically.&nbsp; Each thread keeps track of which locks it has
acquired.&nbsp; Any violations of the global lock order are logged.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">2. Verify the lock order
statically.&nbsp; In other words, analyze the source code of the
program, and construct a proof that it can never execute such that the
lock order is violated at runtime.&nbsp; This is a much stronger
guarantee: if the verification is successful, then we know that there
will never be deadlocks at runtime.&nbsp; Problem is that verification
is a hard problem, especially when locks may be created dynamically (so
we don't know the set of locks in advance.)<br>
</p>
<h3>Deadlock Avoidance<br>
</h3>
<p>Threads must announce which locks they wish to acquire in advance.<br>
</p>
<p>Resource graph algorithm (for resources with a single instance):<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A process must add a claim edge to the
resource graph before it can acquire the resource (converting the edge
into a request edge).&nbsp; All of the claim edges must be added at the
same time, in advance: once a thread has any request edges in the
resource graph, it cannot add any claim edges.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A claim edge can be converted into a
request edge at any time.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A request edge can be turned into an
assignment edge only if the resulting resource graph has no
cycles.&nbsp; A process attempting to turn a request edge into an
assignment edge must wait until it can do so without creating a cycle.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Note that the book claims that detecting
a cycle in a graph is O(n<sup>2</sup>), where n is the number of
processes.&nbsp;
This is not really accurate.&nbsp; It would be more correct to say that
cycle detection takes O(|V| + |E|) time, where |V| is the number of
vertices and |E| is the number of edges.&nbsp; It is true that |E| can
be O(|V|<sup>2</sup>): however, that is extremely unlikely, since that
it would
imply a graph that was nearly fully connected, meaning that nearly
every thread had some kind of edge to or from nearly every
resource.&nbsp; Most systems simply won't exhibit such behavior.<br>
</p>
<p>The book presents some more general strategies for deadlock
avoidance when there are multiple instances of resources.</p>
